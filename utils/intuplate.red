; It might seem like just a party trick, out of context. The goal is not "look how 
; we can twist the language around!". Think, instead, of how you can use the language 
; to most clearly express intent in different domains, or for different users. Quite 
; often, when a user wants a different way to express things, we can accommodate them. 
; It's also true that we can suggest a form that exists natively in Red, and they will 
; be just as happy.

; Don't twist the language because you can. But don't be afraid to when it helps.

	set [a b c d e f g h i j] untup 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10
