;- Extended Result Codes
;  KEYWORDS: {extended result code definitions}
; 
;  In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 30 integer
;  [result codes].  However, experience has shown that many of
;  these result codes are too coarse-grained.  They do not provide as
;  much information about problems as programmers might like.  In an effort to
;  address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 [dateof:3.3.8]
;  and later) include
;  support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
;  about errors. These [extended result codes] are enabled or disabled
;  on a per database connection basis using the
;  [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()] API.  Or, the extended code for
;  the most recent error can be obtained using
;  [sqlite3_extended_errcode()].

;- Device Characteristics
; 
;  The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the [sqlite3_io_methods]
;  object returns an integer which is a vector of these
;  bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage
;  device that holds the file that the [sqlite3_io_methods]
;  refers to.
; 
;  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
;  any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
;  mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
;  are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
;  nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
;  that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
;  first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
;  way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
;  information is written to disk in the same order as calls
;  to xWrite().  The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that
;  after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a
;  file that were written at the application level might have changed
;  and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are
;  guaranteed to be unchanged.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN
;  flag indicates that a file cannot be deleted when open.  The
;  SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on
;  read-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with
;  elevated privileges.

;- File Locking Levels
; 
;  SQLite uses one of these integer values as the second
;  argument to calls it makes to the xLock() and xUnlock() methods
;  of an [sqlite3_io_methods] object.

#define SQLITE_LOCK_NONE          0
#define SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED        1
#define SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED      2
#define SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING       3
#define SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE     4


;- Synchronization Type Flags
; 
;  When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an
;  [sqlite3_io_methods] object it uses a combination of
;  these integer values as the second argument.
; 
;  When the SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the
;  sync operation only needs to flush data to mass storage.  Inode
;  information need not be flushed. If the lower four bits of the flag
;  equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
;  If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means
;  to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
; 
;  Do not confuse the SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags
;  with the [PRAGMA synchronous]=NORMAL and [PRAGMA synchronous]=FULL
;  settings.  The [synchronous pragma] determines when calls to the
;  xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
;  The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how
;  energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and
;  only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
;  (Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction
;  between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the
;  operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX
;  cares about the difference.)

#define SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL        00000002h
#define SQLITE_SYNC_FULL          00000003h
#define SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY      00000010h


;- Standard File Control Opcodes
;  KEYWORDS: {file control opcodes} {file control opcode}
; 
;  These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
;  of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
;  interface.
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
;  opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
;  the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
;  [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
;  into an integer that the pArg argument points to. This capability
;  is used during testing and is only available when the SQLITE_TEST
;  compile-time option is used.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
;  layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
;  current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
;  is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
;  file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
;  file run faster.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
;  extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
;  by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should 
;  point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
;  for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
;  chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
;  improve performance on some systems.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
;  to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
;  connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER].
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
;  to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with the journal file (either
;  the [rollback journal] or the [write-ahead log]) for a particular database
;  connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER].
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
;  No longer in use.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
;  sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
;  database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked 
;  because the user has configured SQLite with 
;  [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place 
;  of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
;  this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
;  as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
;  string containing the transactions master-journal file name. VFSes that 
;  do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications 
;  should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may 
;  disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
;  and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
;  but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
;  should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
;  [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the 
;  operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
;  retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
;  windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
;  anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
;  file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
;  of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
;  by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
;  opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
;  to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
;  within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
;  integers where the first integer i the new retry count and the second
;  integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
;  is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
;  into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
;  interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
;  persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
;  write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control
;  are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
;  closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
;  close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
;  have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
;  to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
;  in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
;  [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
;  That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
;  WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
;  WAL persistence setting.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
;  persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
;  determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
;  xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
;  [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
;  That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
;  mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
;  zero-damage mode setting.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
;  a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
;  reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current 
;  transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
;  all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
;  final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from 
;  [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
;  that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
;  The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
;  all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
;  do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
;  pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
;  is intended for diagnostic use only.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER] opcode finds a pointer to the top-level
;  [VFSes] currently in use.  ^(The argument X in
;  sqlite3_file_control(db,SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER,X) must be
;  of type "[sqlite3_vfs] ; ".  This opcodes will set *X
;  to a pointer to the top-level VFS.)^
;  ^When there are multiple VFS shims in the stack, this opcode finds the
;  upper-most shim only.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
;  ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] 
;  file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
;  to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
;  to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
;  pointers to strings (char; ) in which the second element of the array
;  is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
;  pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
;  [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
;  of the char;  argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
;  or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
;  the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
;  [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal 
;  [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
;  file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
;  VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
;  prepared statement if result string is NULL, or that returns a copy
;  of the result string if the string is non-NULL.
;  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
;  any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
;  that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
;  compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
;  file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
;  it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
;  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
;  file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
;  shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
;  to the connections busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void ; )
;  - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
;  to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connections
;  busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
;  the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
;  should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
;  current operation.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
;  ^Application can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
;  to have SQLite generate a
;  temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
;  temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
;  argument should be a char;  which will be filled with the filename
;  written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  The caller should
;  invoke [sqlite3_free()] on the result to avoid a memory leak.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE] file control is used to query or set the
;  maximum number of bytes that will be used for memory-mapped I/O.
;  The argument is a pointer to a value of type sqlite3_int64 that
;  is an advisory maximum number of bytes in the file to memory map.  The
;  pointer is overwritten with the old value.  The limit is not changed if
;  the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit 
;  can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.  This
;  file-control is used internally to implement [PRAGMA mmap_size].
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE] file control provides advisory information
;  to the VFS about what the higher layers of the SQLite stack are doing.
;  This file control is used by some VFS activity tracing [shims].
;  The argument is a zero-terminated string.  Higher layers in the
;  SQLite stack may generate instances of this file control if
;  the [SQLITE_USE_FCNTL_TRACE] compile-time option is enabled.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED] file control interprets its argument as a
;  pointer to an integer and it writes a boolean into that integer depending
;  on whether or not the file has been renamed, moved, or deleted since it
;  was first opened.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE] opcode can be used to obtain the
;  underlying native file handle associated with a file handle.  This file
;  control interprets its argument as a pointer to a native file handle and
;  writes the resulting value there.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
;  opcode causes the xFileControl method to swap the file handle with the one
;  pointed to by the pArg argument.  This capability is used during testing
;  and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST is defined.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK] is a signal to the VFS layer that it might
;  be advantageous to block on the next WAL lock if the lock is not immediately
;  available.  The WAL subsystem issues this signal during rare
;  circumstances in order to fix a problem with priority inversion.
;  Applications should <em>not</em> use this file-control.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS] opcode is implemented by zipvfs only. All other
;  VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for this opcode.
; 
;  <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU]]
;  The [SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU] opcode is implemented by the special VFS used by
;  the RBU extension only.  All other VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for
;  this opcode.

;- Authorizer Action Codes
; 
;  The [sqlite3_set_authorizer()] interface registers a callback function
;  that is invoked to authorize certain SQL statement actions.  The
;  second parameter to the callback is an integer code that specifies
;  what action is being authorized.  These are the integer action codes that
;  the authorizer callback may be passed.
; 
;  These action code values signify what kind of operation is to be
;  authorized.  The 3rd and 4th parameters to the authorization
;  callback function will be parameters or NULL depending on which of these
;  codes is used as the second parameter.  ^(The 5th parameter to the
;  authorizer callback is the name of the database ("main", "temp",
;  etc.) if applicable.)^  ^The 6th parameter to the authorizer callback
;  is the name of the inner-most trigger or view that is responsible for
;  the access attempt or NULL if this access attempt is directly from
;  top-level SQL code.

;- Checkpoint Mode Values
;  KEYWORDS: {checkpoint mode}
; 
;  These constants define all valid values for the "checkpoint mode" passed

;- Virtual Table Configuration Options
; 
;  These macros define the various options to the
;  [sqlite3_vtab_config()] interface that [virtual table] implementations
;  can use to customize and optimize their behavior.
; 
;  <dl>
;  <dt>SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT
;  <dd>Calls of the form
;  [sqlite3_vtab_config](db,SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT,X) are supported,
;  where X is an integer.  If X is zero, then the [virtual table] whose
;  [xCreate] or [xConnect] method invoked [sqlite3_vtab_config()] does not
;  support constraints.  In this configuration (which is the default) if
;  a call to the [xUpdate] method returns [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], then the entire
;  statement is rolled back as if [ON CONFLICT | OR ABORT] had been
;  specified as part of the users SQL statement, regardless of the actual
;  ON CONFLICT mode specified.
; 
;  If X is non-zero, then the virtual table implementation guarantees
;  that if [xUpdate] returns [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], it will do so before
;  any modifications to internal or persistent data structures have been made.
;  If the [ON CONFLICT] mode is ABORT, FAIL, IGNORE or ROLLBACK, SQLite 
;  is able to roll back a statement or database transaction, and abandon
;  or continue processing the current SQL statement as appropriate. 
;  If the ON CONFLICT mode is REPLACE and the [xUpdate] method returns
;  [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], SQLite handles this as if the ON CONFLICT mode
;  had been ABORT.
; 
;  Virtual table implementations that are required to handle OR REPLACE
;  must do so within the [xUpdate] method. If a call to the 
;  [sqlite3_vtab_on_conflict()] function indicates that the current ON 
;  CONFLICT policy is REPLACE, the virtual table implementation should 
;  silently replace the appropriate rows within the xUpdate callback and
;  return SQLITE_OK. Or, if this is not possible, it may return
;  SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, in which case SQLite falls back to OR ABORT 
;  constraint handling.
;  </dl>

;    (non primary-key) fields modified by the update do not contain the 
;    expected "before" values.
;  
;    The conflicting row, in this case, is the database row with the matching

; 
;  <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY<dd>
;    If foreign key handling is enabled, and applying a changeset leaves the
;    database in a state containing foreign key violations, the conflict 
;    handler is invoked with CHANGESET_FOREIGN_KEY as the second argument
;    exactly once before the changeset is committed. If the conflict handler

;- Constants Returned By The Conflict Handler
; 
;  A conflict handler callback must return one of the following three values.
; 
;  <dl>
;  <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT<dd>
;    If a conflict handler returns this value no special action is taken. The
;    change that caused the conflict is not applied. The session module 
;    continues to the next change in the changeset.
; 
;  <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE<dd>
;    This value may only be returned if the second argument to the conflict
;    handler was SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA or SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT. If this
;    is not the case, any changes applied so far are rolled back and the 
;    call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns SQLITE_MISUSE.
; 
;    If CHANGESET_REPLACE is returned by an SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflict
;    handler, then the conflicting row is either updated or deleted, depending
;    on the type of change.
; 
;    If CHANGESET_REPLACE is returned by an SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT conflict
;    handler, then the conflicting row is removed from the database and a
;    second attempt to apply the change is made. If this second attempt fails,
;    the original row is restored to the database before continuing.
; 
;  <dt>SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT<dd>
;    If this value is returned, any changes applied so far are rolled back 
;    and the call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns SQLITE_ABORT.

;- Test To See If The Library Is Threadsafe
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_threadsafe() function returns zero if and only if
;  SQLite was compiled with mutexing code omitted due to the
;  [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] compile-time option being set to 0.
; 
;  SQLite can be compiled with or without mutexes.  When
;  the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] C preprocessor macro is 1 or 2, mutexes
;  are enabled and SQLite is threadsafe.  When the
;  [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro is 0, 
;  the mutexes are omitted.  Without the mutexes, it is not safe
;  to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.
; 
;  Enabling mutexes incurs a measurable performance penalty.
;  So if speed is of utmost importance, it makes sense to disable
;  the mutexes.  But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
;  ^The default behavior is for mutexes to be enabled.
; 
;  This interface can be used by an application to make sure that the
;  version of SQLite that it is linking against was compiled with
;  the desired setting of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro.
; 
;  This interface only reports on the compile-time mutex setting
;  of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] flag.  If SQLite is compiled with
;  SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 or =2 then mutexes are enabled by default but
;  can be fully or partially disabled using a call to [sqlite3_config()]
;  with the verbs [SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD], [SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD],
;  or [SQLITE_CONFIG_SERIALIZED].  ^(The return value of the

;  sqlite3_config(). In other words, the return value from sqlite3_threadsafe()
;  is unchanged by calls to sqlite3_config().)^

;- Closing A Database Connection
;  DESTRUCTOR: sqlite3

;  ^The sqlite3_close() and sqlite3_close_v2() routines are destructors
;  for the [sqlite3] object.
;  ^Calls to sqlite3_close() and sqlite3_close_v2() return [SQLITE_OK] if
;  the [sqlite3] object is successfully destroyed and all associated
;  resources are deallocated.
; 
;  ^If the database connection is associated with unfinalized prepared
;  statements or unfinished sqlite3_backup objects then sqlite3_close()
;  will leave the database connection open and return [SQLITE_BUSY].
;  ^If sqlite3_close_v2() is called with unfinalized prepared statements
;  and/or unfinished sqlite3_backups, then the database connection becomes
;  an unusable "zombie" which will automatically be deallocated when the
;  last prepared statement is finalized or the last sqlite3_backup is
;  finished.  The sqlite3_close_v2() interface is intended for use with
;  host languages that are garbage collected, and where the order in which
;  destructors are called is arbitrary.
; 
;  Applications should [sqlite3_finalize | finalize] all [prepared statements],
;  [sqlite3_blob_close | close] all [BLOB handles], and 
;  [sqlite3_backup_finish | finish] all [sqlite3_backup] objects associated
;  with the [sqlite3] object prior to attempting to close the object.  ^If
;  sqlite3_close_v2() is called on a [database connection] that still has

;- One-Step Query Execution Interface
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  The sqlite3_exec() interface is a convenience wrapper around
;  [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()],
;  that allows an application to run multiple statements of SQL
;  without having to use a lot of C code. 
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,
;  semicolon-separate SQL statements passed into its 2nd argument,
;  in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
;  argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
;  sqlite3_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
;  coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
;  sqlite3_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
;  callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite3_exec()
;  is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
;  ignored.
; 
;  ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
;  sqlite3_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
;  subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec()
;  is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
;  from [sqlite3_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
;  To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite3_free()]
;  on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
;  sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
;  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec() is not NULL and no errors
;  occur, then sqlite3_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
;  NULL before returning.
; 
;  ^If an sqlite3_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite3_exec()
;  routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
;  without running any subsequent SQL statements.
; 
;  ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite3_exec() callback function is the
;  number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite3_exec()
;  callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
;  [sqlite3_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
;  result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
;  sqlite3_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
;  sqlite3_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
;  entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
;  from [sqlite3_column_name()].
; 
;  ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite3_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
;  to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or 
;  SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
;  is not changed.
;

;- Initialize The SQLite Library
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
;  SQLite library.  ^The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
;  deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
;  These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and
;  shutdown on embedded systems.  Workstation applications using
;  SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.
; 
;  A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
;  the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
;  the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
;  following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  ^(Only an effective call
;  of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
;  are harmless no-ops.)^
; 
;  A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
;  call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  ^(Only
;  an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
;  All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.)^
; 
;  The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown()
;  is not.  The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a
;  single thread.  All open [database connections] must be closed and all
;  other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking
;  sqlite3_shutdown().
; 
;  Among other things, ^sqlite3_initialize() will invoke
;  sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, ^sqlite3_shutdown()
;  will invoke sqlite3_os_end().
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
;  ^If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
;  the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
;  as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
;  SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
;  invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
;  calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
;  initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
;  already.  ^However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
;  compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
;  are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
;  prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
;  it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
;  directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
;  of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
;  when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
;  default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
; 
;  The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
;  initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
;  routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
;  performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
;  of static resources, initialization of global variables,
;  setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
;  a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
; 
;  The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
;  or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
;  sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
;  interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
;  sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
;  implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
;  are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2.
;  When [custom builds | built for other platforms]
;  (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
;  option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
;  sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied
;  implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end()
;  must return [SQLITE_OK] on success and some other [error code] upon
;  failure.

;- Configuring The SQLite Library

;  applications and so this routine is usually not necessary.  It is
;  provided to support rare applications with unusual needs.

;  must ensure that no other SQLite interfaces are invoked by other
;  threads while sqlite3_config() is running.</b>

;  [sqlite3_shutdown()] then it will return SQLITE_MISUSE.
;  Note, however, that ^sqlite3_config() can be called as part of the
;  implementation of an application-defined [sqlite3_os_init()].
; 
;  The first argument to sqlite3_config() is an integer
;  [configuration option] that determines
;  what property of SQLite is to be configured.  Subsequent arguments
;  vary depending on the [configuration option]
;  in the first argument.
; 
;  ^When a configuration option is set, sqlite3_config() returns [SQLITE_OK].

;- Last Insert Rowid
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^Each entry in most SQLite tables (except for [WITHOUT ROWID] tables)

;  as an undeclared column named ROWID, OID, or _ROWID_ as long as those
;  names are not also used by explicitly declared columns. ^If
;  the table has a column of type [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY] then that column
;  is another alias for the rowid.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) interface usually returns the [rowid] of
;  the most recent successful [INSERT] into a rowid table or [virtual table]
;  on database connection D. ^Inserts into [WITHOUT ROWID] tables are not
;  recorded. ^If no successful [INSERT]s into rowid tables have ever occurred 
;  on the database connection D, then sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) returns 
;  zero.
; 
;  As well as being set automatically as rows are inserted into database
;  tables, the value returned by this function may be set explicitly by
;  [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()]
; 
;  Some virtual table implementations may INSERT rows into rowid tables as
;  part of committing a transaction (e.g. to flush data accumulated in memory
;  to disk). In this case subsequent calls to this function return the rowid
;  associated with these internal INSERT operations, which leads to 
;  unintuitive results. Virtual table implementations that do write to rowid
;  tables in this way can avoid this problem by restoring the original 
;  rowid value using [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()] before returning 
;  control to the user.
; 
;  ^(If an [INSERT] occurs within a trigger then this routine will 
;  return the [rowid] of the inserted row as long as the trigger is 
;  running. Once the trigger program ends, the value returned 
;  by this routine reverts to what it was before the trigger was fired.)^
; 
;  ^An [INSERT] that fails due to a constraint violation is not a
;  successful [INSERT] and does not change the value returned by this
;  routine.  ^Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK,
;  and INSERT OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this
;  routine when their insertion fails.  ^(When INSERT OR REPLACE
;  encounters a constraint violation, it does not fail.  The
;  INSERT continues to completion after deleting rows that caused
;  the constraint problem so INSERT OR REPLACE will always change

;  Things are more complicated if the sqlite3_changes() function is

;  
;  <ul>
;    <li> ^(Before entering a trigger program the value returned by

;         has finished, the original value is restored.)^

;- Register A Callback To Handle SQLITE_BUSY Errors
;  KEYWORDS: {busy-handler callback} {busy handler}
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_busy_handler(D,X,P) routine sets a callback function X
;  that might be invoked with argument P whenever
;  an attempt is made to access a database table associated with
;  [database connection] D when another thread
;  or process has the table locked.
;  The sqlite3_busy_handler() interface is used to implement
;  [sqlite3_busy_timeout()] and [PRAGMA busy_timeout].
; 
;  ^If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
;  is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.  ^If the busy callback
;  is not NULL, then the callback might be invoked with two arguments.
; 
;  ^The first argument to the busy handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
;  is the third argument to sqlite3_busy_handler().  ^The second argument to
;  the busy handler callback is the number of times that the busy handler has
;  been invoked previously for the same locking event.  ^If the
;  busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
;  access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] is returned
;  to the application.
;  ^If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
;  is made to access the database and the cycle repeats.
; 
;  The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that it will be invoked
;  when there is lock contention. ^If SQLite determines that invoking the busy
;  handler could result in a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY]
;  to the application instead of invoking the 
;  busy handler.
;  Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
;  it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
;  a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
;  to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
;  because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
;  proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
;  invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
;  SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
;  will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
;  the second process to proceed.
; 
;  ^The default busy callback is NULL.
; 
;  ^(There can only be a single busy handler defined for each
;  [database connection].  Setting a new busy handler clears any
;  previously set handler.)^  ^Note that calling [sqlite3_busy_timeout()]
;  or evaluating [PRAGMA busy_timeout=N] will change the
;  busy handler and thus clear any previously set busy handler.
; 
;  The busy callback should not take any actions which modify the
;  database connection that invoked the busy handler.  In other words,
;  the busy handler is not reentrant.  Any such actions
;  result in undefined behavior.
;  
;  A busy handler must not close the database connection
;  or [prepared statement] that invoked the busy handler.

;- Convenience Routines For Running Queries
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.
;  Use of this interface is not recommended.
; 
;  Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
;  [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
;  complete query results from one or more queries.
; 
;  The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
;  these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
;  numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
;  and M be the number of columns.
; 
;  A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
;  There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
;  to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
;  The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
;  in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
;  string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
; 
;  A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
;  It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
;  A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
; 
;  ^(As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
;  is as follows:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;         Name        | Age
;         -----------------------
;         Alice       | 43
;         Bob         | 28
;         Cindy       | 21
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
;  result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
;  in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;         azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
;         azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
;         azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
;         azResult&#91;3] = "43";
;         azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
;         azResult&#91;5] = "28";
;         azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
;         azResult&#91;7] = "21";
;  </pre></blockquote>)^
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
;  semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
;  string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the
;  pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
; 
;  After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(),
;  it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
;  release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
;  [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
;  function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
;  [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
; 
;  The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
;  [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
;  to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
;  interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
;  wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
;  reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or
;  [sqlite3_errmsg()].

;- Formatted String Printing Functions
; 
;  These routines are work-alikes of the "printf()" family of functions
;  from the standard C library.
;  These routines understand most of the common K&R formatting options,
;  plus some additional non-standard formats, detailed below.
;  Note that some of the more obscure formatting options from recent
;  C-library standards are omitted from this implementation.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
;  results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
;  The strings returned by these two routines should be
;  released by [sqlite3_free()].  ^Both routines return a
;  NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
;  memory to hold the resulting string.
; 
;  ^(The sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
;  the standard C library.  The result is written into the
;  buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
;  the first parameter. Note that the order of the
;  first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().)^  This is an
;  historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
;  backwards compatibility.  ^(Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
;  returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
;  characters actually written into the buffer.)^  We admit that
;  the number of characters written would be a more useful return
;  value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
;  now without breaking compatibility.
; 
;  ^As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
;  guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  ^The first
;  parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
;  the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
;  written will be n-1 characters.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite3_snprintf().
; 
;  These routines all implement some additional formatting
;  options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
;  All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
;  is are "%q", "%Q", "%w" and "%z" options.
; 
;  ^(The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a nul-terminated
;  string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
;  %q is designed for use inside a string literal.)^  By doubling each '\''
;  character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
;  the string.
; 
;  For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;   char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;   char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
;   sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
;   sqlite3_free(zSQL);
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
;  is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;   INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
;  would have looked like this:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;   INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
;  always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
; 
;  ^(The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
;  the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
;  argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
;  single quotes).)^  So, for example, one could say:
; 
;  <blockquote><pre>
;   char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
;   sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
;   sqlite3_free(zSQL);
;  </pre></blockquote>
; 
;  The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
;  variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
; 
;  ^(The "%w" formatting option is like "%q" except that it expects to
;  be contained within double-quotes instead of single quotes, and it
;  escapes the double-quote character instead of the single-quote
;  character.)^  The "%w" formatting option is intended for safely inserting
;  table and column names into a constructed SQL statement.
; 
;  ^(The "%z" formatting option works like "%s" but with the
;  addition that after the string has been read and copied into
;  the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string.)^

;- Memory Allocation Subsystem
; 
;  The SQLite core uses these three routines for all of its own
;  internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
;  does not include operating-system specific VFS implementation.  The
;  Windows VFS uses native malloc() and free() for some operations.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
;  of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
;  ^If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
;  memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  ^If the parameter N to
;  sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
;  a NULL pointer.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_malloc64(N) routine works just like
;  sqlite3_malloc(N) except that N is an unsigned 64-bit integer instead
;  of a signed 32-bit integer.
; 
;  ^Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
;  by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
;  that it might be reused.  ^The sqlite3_free() routine is
;  a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
;  to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
;  should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
;  memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
;  Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
;  might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
;  was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_realloc(X,N) interface attempts to resize a
;  prior memory allocation X to be at least N bytes.
;  ^If the X parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N)
;  is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
;  sqlite3_malloc(N).
;  ^If the N parameter to sqlite3_realloc(X,N) is zero or
;  negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
;  sqlite3_free(X).
;  ^sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns a pointer to a memory allocation
;  of at least N bytes in size or NULL if insufficient memory is available.
;  ^If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
;  of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
;  by sqlite3_realloc(X,N) and the prior allocation is freed.
;  ^If sqlite3_realloc(X,N) returns NULL and N is positive, then the
;  prior allocation is not freed.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_realloc64(X,N) interfaces works the same as
;  sqlite3_realloc(X,N) except that N is a 64-bit unsigned integer instead
;  of a 32-bit signed integer.
; 
;  ^If X is a memory allocation previously obtained from sqlite3_malloc(),
;  sqlite3_malloc64(), sqlite3_realloc(), or sqlite3_realloc64(), then
;  sqlite3_msize(X) returns the size of that memory allocation in bytes.
;  ^The value returned by sqlite3_msize(X) might be larger than the number
;  of bytes requested when X was allocated.  ^If X is a NULL pointer then
;  sqlite3_msize(X) returns zero.  If X points to something that is not
;  the beginning of memory allocation, or if it points to a formerly
;  valid memory allocation that has now been freed, then the behavior
;  of sqlite3_msize(X) is undefined and possibly harmful.
; 
;  ^The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc(), sqlite3_realloc(),
;  sqlite3_malloc64(), and sqlite3_realloc64()
;  is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary, or to a
;  4 byte boundary if the [SQLITE_4_BYTE_ALIGNED_MALLOC] compile-time
;  option is used.
; 
;  In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define
;  the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION which would cause the built-in
;  implementation of these routines to be omitted.  That capability
;  is no longer provided.  Only built-in memory allocators can be used.
; 
;  Prior to SQLite version 3.7.10, the Windows OS interface layer called
;  the system malloc() and free() directly when converting
;  filenames between the UTF-8 encoding used by SQLite
;  and whatever filename encoding is used by the particular Windows
;  installation.  Memory allocation errors were detected, but
;  they were reported back as [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] or
;  [SQLITE_IOERR] rather than [SQLITE_NOMEM].
; 
;  The pointer arguments to [sqlite3_free()] and [sqlite3_realloc()]
;  must be either NULL or else pointers obtained from a prior
;  invocation of [sqlite3_malloc()] or [sqlite3_realloc()] that have
;  not yet been released.
; 
;  The application must not read or write any part of
;  a block of memory after it has been released using
;  [sqlite3_free()] or [sqlite3_realloc()].

;- Memory Allocator Statistics
; 
;  SQLite provides these two interfaces for reporting on the status
;  of the [sqlite3_malloc()], [sqlite3_free()], and [sqlite3_realloc()]
;  routines, which form the built-in memory allocation subsystem.
; 
;  ^The [sqlite3_memory_used()] routine returns the number of bytes
;  of memory currently outstanding (malloced but not freed).
;  ^The [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] routine returns the maximum
;  value of [sqlite3_memory_used()] since the high-water mark
;  was last reset.  ^The values returned by [sqlite3_memory_used()] and
;  [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] include any overhead
;  added by SQLite in its implementation of [sqlite3_malloc()],
;  but not overhead added by the any underlying system library
;  routines that [sqlite3_malloc()] may call.
; 
;  ^The memory high-water mark is reset to the current value of
;  [sqlite3_memory_used()] if and only if the parameter to
;  [sqlite3_memory_highwater()] is true.  ^The value returned
;  by [sqlite3_memory_highwater(1)] is the high-water mark
;  prior to the reset.

;- Pseudo-Random Number Generator
; 
;  SQLite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to
;  select random [ROWID | ROWIDs] when inserting new records into a table that
;  already uses the largest possible [ROWID].  The PRNG is also used for
;  the build-in random() and randomblob() SQL functions.  This interface allows
;  applications to access the same PRNG for other purposes.
; 
;  ^A call to this routine stores N bytes of randomness into buffer P.
;  ^The P parameter can be a NULL pointer.
; 
;  ^If this routine has not been previously called or if the previous
;  call had N less than one or a NULL pointer for P, then the PRNG is
;  seeded using randomness obtained from the xRandomness method of
;  the default [sqlite3_vfs] object.
;  ^If the previous call to this routine had an N of 1 or more and a
;  non-NULL P then the pseudo-randomness is generated
;  internally and without recourse to the [sqlite3_vfs] xRandomness
;  method.

;- Compile-Time Authorization Callbacks
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^This routine registers an authorizer callback with a particular
;  [database connection], supplied in the first argument.
;  ^The authorizer callback is invoked as SQL statements are being compiled
;  by [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants [sqlite3_prepare_v2()],
;  [sqlite3_prepare16()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()].  ^At various
;  points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
;  to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
;  see if those actions are allowed.  ^The authorizer callback should
;  return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
;  specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
;  compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
;  rejected with an error.  ^If the authorizer callback returns
;  any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
;  then the [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
;  the authorizer will fail with an error message.
; 
;  When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
;  requested is ok.  ^When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
;  [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
;  authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
;  access is denied. 
; 
;  ^The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
;  parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. ^The second parameter
;  to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
;  the particular action to be authorized. ^The third through sixth parameters
;  to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
;  details about the action to be authorized.
; 
;  ^If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
;  and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
;  [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
;  a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
;  been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
;  return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
;  columns of a table.
;  ^If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
;  [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
;  [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
; 
;  An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
;  SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
;  do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
;  try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
;  example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
;  SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
;  not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
;  database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
;  user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
;  disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
; 
;  Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
;  might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
;  and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
;  in addition to using an authorizer.
; 
;  ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
;  at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
;  previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
;  The authorizer is disabled by default.
; 
;  The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
;  the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
;  Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
;  database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
; 
;  ^When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
;  statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a 
;  schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
;  correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
; 
;  ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
;  [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
;  performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()], unless
;  as stated in the previous paragraph, sqlite3_step() invokes
;  sqlite3_prepare_v2() to reprepare a statement after a schema change.

;- Tracing And Profiling Functions
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  These routines are deprecated. Use the [sqlite3_trace_v2()] interface
;  instead of the routines described here.
; 
;  These routines register callback functions that can be used for
;  tracing and profiling the execution of SQL statements.
; 
;  ^The callback function registered by sqlite3_trace() is invoked at
;  various times when an SQL statement is being run by [sqlite3_step()].
;  ^The sqlite3_trace() callback is invoked with a UTF-8 rendering of the
;  SQL statement text as the statement first begins executing.
;  ^(Additional sqlite3_trace() callbacks might occur
;  as each triggered subprogram is entered.  The callbacks for triggers
;  contain a UTF-8 SQL comment that identifies the trigger.)^
; 
;  The [SQLITE_TRACE_SIZE_LIMIT] compile-time option can be used to limit
;  the length of [bound parameter] expansion in the output of sqlite3_trace().
; 
;  ^The callback function registered by sqlite3_profile() is invoked
;  as each SQL statement finishes.  ^The profile callback contains
;  the original statement text and an estimate of wall-clock time
;  of how long that statement took to run.  ^The profile callback
;  time is in units of nanoseconds, however the current implementation
;  is only capable of millisecond resolution so the six least significant
;  digits in the time are meaningless.  Future versions of SQLite
;  might provide greater resolution on the profiler callback.  The
;  sqlite3_profile() function is considered experimental and is
;  subject to change in future versions of SQLite.

;- SQL Trace Hook
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_trace_v2(D,M,X,P) interface registers a trace callback
;  function X against [database connection] D, using property mask M
;  and context pointer P.  ^If the X callback is
;  NULL or if the M mask is zero, then tracing is disabled.  The
;  M argument should be the bitwise OR-ed combination of
;  zero or more [SQLITE_TRACE] constants.
; 
;  ^Each call to either sqlite3_trace() or sqlite3_trace_v2() overrides 
;  (cancels) any prior calls to sqlite3_trace() or sqlite3_trace_v2().
; 
;  ^The X callback is invoked whenever any of the events identified by 
;  mask M occur.  ^The integer return value from the callback is currently
;  ignored, though this may change in future releases.  Callback
;  implementations should return zero to ensure future compatibility.
; 
;  ^A trace callback is invoked with four arguments: callback(T,C,P,X).
;  ^The T argument is one of the [SQLITE_TRACE]
;  constants to indicate why the callback was invoked.
;  ^The C argument is a copy of the context pointer.
;  The P and X arguments are pointers whose meanings depend on T.
; 
;  The sqlite3_trace_v2() interface is intended to replace the legacy
;  interfaces [sqlite3_trace()] and [sqlite3_profile()], both of which
;  are deprecated.

;- Query Progress Callbacks
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_progress_handler(D,N,X,P) interface causes the callback
;  function X to be invoked periodically during long running calls to
;  [sqlite3_exec()], [sqlite3_step()] and [sqlite3_get_table()] for
;  database connection D.  An example use for this
;  interface is to keep a GUI updated during a large query.
; 
;  ^The parameter P is passed through as the only parameter to the

;  [virtual machine instructions] that are evaluated between successive
;  invocations of the callback X.  ^If N is less than one then the progress
;  handler is disabled.
; 
;  ^Only a single progress handler may be defined at one time per

;  old one.  ^Setting parameter X to NULL disables the progress handler.
;  ^The progress handler is also disabled by setting N to a value less
;  than 1.
; 
;  ^If the progress callback returns non-zero, the operation is
;  interrupted.  This feature can be used to implement a
;  "Cancel" button on a GUI progress dialog box.
; 
;  The progress handler callback must not do anything that will modify
;  the database connection that invoked the progress handler.

;- Opening A New Database Connection
;  CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3
; 
;  ^These routines open an SQLite database file as specified by the 
;  filename argument. ^The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8 for
;  sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() and as UTF-16 in the native byte
;  order for sqlite3_open16(). ^(A [database connection] handle is usually
;  returned in *ppDb, even if an error occurs.  The only exception is that
;  if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object,
;  a NULL will be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3]
;  object.)^ ^(If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then
;  [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an [error code] is returned.)^ ^The
;  [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()] routines can be used to obtain
;  an English language description of the error following a failure of any
;  of the sqlite3_open() routines.
; 
;  ^The default encoding will be UTF-8 for databases created using
;  sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open_v2().  ^The default encoding for databases
;  created using sqlite3_open16() will be UTF-16 in the native byte order.
; 
;  Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
;  associated with the [database connection] handle should be released by
;  passing it to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
; 
;  The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open()
;  except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
;  over the new database connection.  ^(The flags parameter to
;  sqlite3_open_v2() can take one of
;  the following three values, optionally combined with the 
;  [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX], [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX], [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE],
;  [SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE], and/or [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flags:)^

;  already exist, an error is returned.</dd>)^

;  ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]</dt>
;  <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing if possible, or reading
;  only if the file is write protected by the operating system.  In either
;  case the database must already exist, otherwise an error is returned.</dd>)^
; 
;  ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]</dt>
;  <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing, and is created if
;  it does not already exist. This is the behavior that is always used for

;  </dl>
; 
;  If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is not one of the
;  combinations shown above optionally combined with other
;  [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY | SQLITE_OPEN_* bits]
;  then the behavior is undefined.
; 
;  ^If the [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] flag is set, then the database connection
;  opens in the multi-thread [threading mode] as long as the single-thread
;  mode has not been set at compile-time or start-time.  ^If the
;  [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flag is set then the database connection opens
;  in the serialized [threading mode] unless single-thread was
;  previously selected at compile-time or start-time.
;  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE] flag causes the database connection to be
;  eligible to use [shared cache mode], regardless of whether or not shared
;  cache is enabled using [sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()].  ^The
;  [SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE] flag causes the database connection to not
;  participate in [shared cache mode] even if it is enabled.
; 
;  ^The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
;  [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system interface that
;  the new database connection should use.  ^If the fourth parameter is
;  a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs] object is used.
; 
;  ^If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
;  is created for the connection.  ^This in-memory database will vanish when
;  the database connection is closed.  Future versions of SQLite might
;  make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
;  It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with
;  a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as
;  "./" to avoid ambiguity.
; 
;  ^If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary
;  on-disk database will be created.  ^This private database will be
;  automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
; 
;  [[URI filenames in sqlite3_open()]] <h3>URI Filenames</h3>
; 
;  ^If [URI filename] interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument
;  begins with "file:", then the filename is interpreted as a URI. ^URI
;  filename interpretation is enabled if the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flag is
;  set in the fourth argument to sqlite3_open_v2(), or if it has
;  been enabled globally using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_URI] option with the
;  [sqlite3_config()] method or by the [SQLITE_USE_URI] compile-time option.
;  As of SQLite version 3.7.7, URI filename interpretation is turned off
;  by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename
;  interpretation by default.  See "[URI filenames]" for additional
;  information.
; 
;  URI filenames are parsed according to RFC 3986. ^If the URI contains an
;  authority, then it must be either an empty string or the string 
;  "localhost". ^If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an 
;  error is returned to the caller. ^The fragment component of a URI, if 
;  present, is ignored.
; 
;  ^SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
;  which contains the database. ^If the path begins with a '/' character, 
;  then it is interpreted as an absolute path. ^If the path does not begin 
;  with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
;  then the path is interpreted as a relative path. 
;  ^(On windows, the first component of an absolute path 
;  is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").)^
; 
;  [[core URI query parameters]]
;  The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
;  either by SQLite itself, or by a [VFS | custom VFS implementation].
;  SQLite and its built-in [VFSes] interpret the
;  following query parameters:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> <b>vfs</b>: ^The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
;      a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
;      be used to access the database file on disk. ^If this option is set to
;      an empty string the default VFS object is used. ^Specifying an unknown
;      VFS is an error. ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the vfs option is
;      present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
;      the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
; 
;    <li> <b>mode</b>: ^(The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
;      "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
;      an error)^. 
;      ^If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only 
;      access, just as if the [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY] flag had been set in the 
;      third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). ^If the mode option is set to 
;      "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create) 
;      access, as if SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE (but not SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE) had 
;      been set. ^Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both 
;      SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE and SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.  ^If the mode option is
;      set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database] that never reads
;      or writes from disk is used. ^It is an error to specify a value for
;      the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
;      the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
; 
;    <li> <b>cache</b>: ^The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
;      "private". ^Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
;      SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
;      sqlite3_open_v2(). ^Setting the cache parameter to "private" is 
;      equivalent to setting the SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE bit.
;      ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
;      a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
;      SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
; 
;   <li> <b>psow</b>: ^The psow parameter indicates whether or not the
;      [powersafe overwrite] property does or does not apply to the
;      storage media on which the database file resides.
; 
;   <li> <b>nolock</b>: ^The nolock parameter is a boolean query parameter
;      which if set disables file locking in rollback journal modes.  This
;      is useful for accessing a database on a filesystem that does not
;      support locking.  Caution:  Database corruption might result if two
;      or more processes write to the same database and any one of those
;      processes uses nolock=1.
; 
;   <li> <b>immutable</b>: ^The immutable parameter is a boolean query
;      parameter that indicates that the database file is stored on
;      read-only media.  ^When immutable is set, SQLite assumes that the
;      database file cannot be changed, even by a process with higher
;      privilege, and so the database is opened read-only and all locking
;      and change detection is disabled.  Caution: Setting the immutable
;      property on a database file that does in fact change can result
;      in incorrect query results and/or [SQLITE_CORRUPT] errors.
;      See also: [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE].
;        
;  </ul>
; 
;  ^Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
;  error.  Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
;  parameters.  See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite]" for
;  additional information.

;- Obtain Values For URI Parameters
; 
;  These are utility routines, useful to VFS implementations, that check
;  to see if a database file was a URI that contained a specific query 
;  parameter, and if so obtains the value of that query parameter.
; 
;  If F is the database filename pointer passed into the xOpen() method of 
;  a VFS implementation when the flags parameter to xOpen() has one or 
;  more of the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] or [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB] bits set and
;  P is the name of the query parameter, then
;  sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns the value of the P
;  parameter if it exists or a NULL pointer if P does not appear as a 
;  query parameter on F.  If P is a query parameter of F
;  has no explicit value, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns
;  a pointer to an empty string.
; 
;  The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine assumes that P is a boolean
;  parameter and returns true (1) or false (0) according to the value
;  of P.  The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the
;  value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any
;  case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.  The 
;  sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routines returns false (0) if the value of
;  query parameter P is one of "no", "false", or "off" in any case or
;  if the value begins with a numeric zero.  If P is not a query
;  parameter on F or if the value of P is does not match any of the
;  above, then sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns (B!=0).
; 
;  The sqlite3_uri_int64(F,P,D) routine converts the value of P into a
;  64-bit signed integer and returns that integer, or D if P does not
;  exist.  If the value of P is something other than an integer, then
;  zero is returned.
;  
;  If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and
;  sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns B.  If F is not a NULL pointer and
;  is not a database file pathname pointer that SQLite passed into the xOpen
;  VFS method, then the behavior of this routine is undefined and probably
;  undesirable.

;- Error Codes And Messages

;  ^If the most recent sqlite3_* API call associated with

;  then the return value from sqlite3_errcode() is undefined.
;  ^The sqlite3_extended_errcode()
;  interface is the same except that it always returns the 
;  [extended result code] even when extended result codes are
;  disabled.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_errmsg() and sqlite3_errmsg16() return English-language
;  text that describes the error, as either UTF-8 or UTF-16 respectively.
;  ^(Memory to hold the error message string is managed internally.
;  The application does not need to worry about freeing the result.
;  However, the error string might be overwritten or deallocated by

; 
;  When the serialized [threading mode] is in use, it might be the

;  When that happens, the second error will be reported since these

;- Run-time Limits
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^(This interface allows the size of various constructs to be limited
;  on a connection by connection basis.  The first parameter is the
;  [database connection] whose limit is to be set or queried.  The
;  second parameter is one of the [limit categories] that define a
;  class of constructs to be size limited.  The third parameter is the
;  new limit for that construct.)^
; 
;  ^If the new limit is a negative number, the limit is unchanged.
;  ^(For each limit category SQLITE_LIMIT_<i>NAME</i> there is a 
;  [limits | hard upper bound]
;  set at compile-time by a C preprocessor macro called
;  [limits | SQLITE_MAX_<i>NAME</i>].
;  (The "_LIMIT_" in the name is changed to "_MAX_".))^
;  ^Attempts to increase a limit above its hard upper bound are
;  silently truncated to the hard upper bound.
; 
;  ^Regardless of whether or not the limit was changed, the

;  ^Hence, to find the current value of a limit without changing it,
;  simply invoke this interface with the third parameter set to -1.
; 
;  Run-time limits are intended for use in applications that manage
;  both their own internal database and also databases that are controlled
;  by untrusted external sources.  An example application might be a
;  web browser that has its own databases for storing history and
;  separate databases controlled by JavaScript applications downloaded
;  off the Internet.  The internal databases can be given the
;  large, default limits.  Databases managed by external sources can
;  be given much smaller limits designed to prevent a denial of service
;  attack.  Developers might also want to use the [sqlite3_set_authorizer()]
;  interface to further control untrusted SQL.  The size of the database
;  created by an untrusted script can be contained using the
;  [max_page_count] [PRAGMA].
; 
;  New run-time limit categories may be added in future releases.

;- Compiling An SQL Statement
;  KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
;  METHOD: sqlite3
;  CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3_stmt
; 
;  To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
;  program using one of these routines.
; 
;  The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
;  prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
;  [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
; 
;  The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
;  as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
;  interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
;  use UTF-16.
; 
;  ^If the nByte argument is negative, then zSql is read up to the
;  first zero terminator. ^If nByte is positive, then it is the
;  number of bytes read from zSql.  ^If nByte is zero, then no prepared
;  statement is generated.
;  If the caller knows that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then
;  there is a small performance advantage to passing an nByte parameter that
;  is the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
;  the nul-terminator.
; 
;  ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
;  past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
;  compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
;  what remains uncompiled.
; 
;  ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
;  executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
;  to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
;  string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
;  The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
;  SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
;  ppStmt may not be NULL.
; 
;  ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
;  otherwise an [error code] is returned.
; 
;  The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
;  recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
;  for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
;  ^In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
;  that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
;  original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
;  behave differently in three ways:
; 
;  <ol>
;  <li>
;  ^If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
;  always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
;  statement and try to run it again. As many as [SQLITE_MAX_SCHEMA_RETRY]
;  retries will occur before sqlite3_step() gives up and returns an error.
;  </li>
; 
;  <li>
;  ^When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
;  [error codes] or [extended error codes].  ^The legacy behavior was that
;  [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
;  and the application would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()]
;  in order to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
;  interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
;  </li>
; 
;  <li>
;  ^If the specific value bound to [parameter | host parameter] in the 
;  WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement,
;  then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been 
;  a schema change, on the first  [sqlite3_step()] call following any change
;  to the [sqlite3_bind_text | bindings] of that [parameter]. 
;  ^The specific value of WHERE-clause [parameter] might influence the 
;  choice of query plan if the parameter is the left-hand side of a [LIKE]
;  or [GLOB] operator or if the parameter is compared to an indexed column
;  and the [SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3] compile-time option is enabled.
;  </li>

;- Determine If An SQL Statement Writes The Database

;  ^The sqlite3_stmt_readonly(X) interface returns true (non-zero) if
;  and only if the [prepared statement] X makes no direct changes to

; 
;  Note that [application-defined SQL functions] or
;  [virtual tables] might change the database indirectly as a side effect.

; 
;  <blockquote><pre>

;  ^The sqlite3_stmt_readonly() interface returns true for [BEGIN] since

;  KEYWORDS: {SQL parameter} {SQL parameters} {parameter binding}
;  METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
; 
;  ^(In the SQL statement text input to [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and its variants,
;  literals may be replaced by a [parameter] that matches one of following
;  templates:
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li>  ?
;  <li>  ?NNN
;  <li>  :VVV
;  <li>  @VVV
;  <li>  $VVV
;  </ul>
; 
;  In the templates above, NNN represents an integer literal,
;  and VVV represents an alphanumeric identifier.)^  ^The values of these
;  parameters (also called "host parameter names" or "SQL parameters")
;  can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
; 
;  ^The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines is always
;  a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
;  [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants.
; 
;  ^The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
;  ^The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  ^When the same named
;  SQL parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
;  occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
;  ^The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
;  [sqlite3_bind_parameter_index()] API if desired.  ^The index
;  for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
;  ^The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite3_limit()]
;  parameter [SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 999).
; 
;  ^The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
;  ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() or sqlite3_bind_text16()
;  or sqlite3_bind_blob() is a NULL pointer then the fourth parameter
;  is ignored and the end result is the same as sqlite3_bind_null().
; 
;  ^(In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the
;  number of bytes in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the
;  number of <u>bytes</u> in the value, not the number of characters.)^
;  ^If the fourth parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() or sqlite3_bind_text16()
;  is negative, then the length of the string is
;  the number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
;  If the fourth parameter to sqlite3_bind_blob() is negative, then
;  the behavior is undefined.
;  If a non-negative fourth parameter is provided to sqlite3_bind_text()
;  or sqlite3_bind_text16() or sqlite3_bind_text64() then
;  that parameter must be the byte offset
;  where the NUL terminator would occur assuming the string were NUL
;  terminated.  If any NUL characters occur at byte offsets less than 
;  the value of the fourth parameter then the resulting string value will
;  contain embedded NULs.  The result of expressions involving strings
;  with embedded NULs is undefined.
; 
;  ^The fifth argument to the BLOB and string binding interfaces
;  is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
;  string after SQLite has finished with it.  ^The destructor is called
;  to dispose of the BLOB or string even if the call to bind API fails.
;  ^If the fifth argument is
;  the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
;  information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
;  ^If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
;  SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
;  the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
; 
;  ^The sixth argument to sqlite3_bind_text64() must be one of
;  [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16], [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or [SQLITE_UTF16LE]
;  to specify the encoding of the text in the third parameter.  If
;  the sixth argument to sqlite3_bind_text64() is not one of the
;  allowed values shown above, or if the text encoding is different
;  from the encoding specified by the sixth parameter, then the behavior
;  is undefined.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
;  is filled with zeroes.  ^A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
;  (just an integer to hold its size) while it is being processed.
;  Zeroblobs are intended to serve as placeholders for BLOBs whose
;  content is later written using
;  [sqlite3_blob_open | incremental BLOB I/O] routines.
;  ^A negative value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
; 
;  ^If any of the sqlite3_bind_*() routines are called with a NULL pointer
;  for the [prepared statement] or with a prepared statement for which
;  [sqlite3_step()] has been called more recently than [sqlite3_reset()],
;  then the call will return [SQLITE_MISUSE].  If any sqlite3_bind_()
;  routine is passed a [prepared statement] that has been finalized, the
;  result is undefined and probably harmful.
; 
;  ^Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
;  ^Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_bind_* routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an
;  [error code] if anything goes wrong.
;  ^[SQLITE_TOOBIG] might be returned if the size of a string or BLOB
;  exceeds limits imposed by [sqlite3_limit]([SQLITE_LIMIT_LENGTH]) or
;  [SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH].
;  ^[SQLITE_RANGE] is returned if the parameter
;  index is out of range.  ^[SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc() fails.

;  ^With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
;  [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
; 
;  ^[SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
;  database locks it needs to do its job.  ^If the statement is a [COMMIT]
;  or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
;  statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
;  explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
;  continuing.
; 
;  ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
;  successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
;  machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
;  machine back to its initial state.
; 
;  ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
;  is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
;  caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
;  sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
; 
;  ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
;  violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
;  the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
;  ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
;  [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
;  can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
;  [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
;  the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
; 
;  [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
;  Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
;  already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
;  previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
;  be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
;  more threads at the same moment in time.
; 
;  For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
;  [sqlite3_reset()] was required after sqlite3_step() returned anything
;  other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
;  sqlite3_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using 
;  [sqlite3_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
;  sqlite3_step().  But after [version 3.6.23.1] ([dateof:3.6.23.1],
;  sqlite3_step() began
;  calling [sqlite3_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
;  than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
;  break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
;  is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
;  can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
; 
;  <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()
;  API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
;  error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
;  [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
;  specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
;  We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
;  with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
;  using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
;  of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,
;  then the more specific [error codes] are returned directly
;  by sqlite3_step().  The use of the "v2" interface is recommended.

;- Result Values From A Query
;  KEYWORDS: {column access functions}
;  METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
; 
;  ^These routines return information about a single column of the current
;  result row of a query.  ^In every case the first argument is a pointer
;  to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
;  that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
;  and the second argument is the index of the column for which information

;  ^The number of columns in the result can be determined using
;  [sqlite3_column_count()].
; 
;  If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
;  column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
;  These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
;  [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
;  [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
;  If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
;  [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
;  something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
;  If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
;  are called from a different thread while any of these routines
;  are pending, then the results are undefined.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
;  [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
;  of the result column.  ^The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
;  [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
;  returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
;  conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
;  the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
;  versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
;  following a type conversion.
; 
;  ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
;  routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
;  ^If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
;  the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
;  ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
;  [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
;  the number of bytes in that string.
;  ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes() returns zero.
; 
;  ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes16()
;  routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
;  ^If the result is a UTF-8 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() converts
;  the string to UTF-16 and then returns the number of bytes.
;  ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes16() uses
;  [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-16 string and returns
;  the number of bytes in that string.
;  ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() returns zero.
; 
;  ^The values returned by [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and 
;  [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] do not include the zero terminators at the end
;  of the string.  ^For clarity: the values returned by
;  [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] are the number of
;  bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
; 
;  ^Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
;  even empty strings, are always zero-terminated.  ^The return
;  value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is a NULL pointer.
; 
;  <b>Warning:</b> ^The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
;  [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  In a multithreaded environment,
;  an unprotected sqlite3_value object may only be used safely with
;  [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
;  If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
;  [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
;  to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
;  or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], the behavior is not threadsafe.
; 
;  These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  ^For
;  example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
;  is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
;  conversion automatically.  ^(The following table details the conversions
;  that are applied:

; 
;  Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
;  calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
;  sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
;  Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
;  in the following cases:
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
;       sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
;       need to be added to the string.</li>
;  <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
;       sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
;       to UTF-16.</li>
;  <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
;       sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
;       to UTF-8.</li>
;  </ul>
; 
;  ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
;  not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
;  that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
;  of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
;  are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
; 
;  The safest policy is to invoke these routines
;  in one of the following ways:
; 
;  <ul>
;   <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
;   <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
;   <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
;  </ul>
; 
;  In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
;  sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
;  into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
;  sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
;  to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to
;  sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16()
;  with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
; 
;  ^The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
;  described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
;  [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  ^The memory space used to hold strings
;  and BLOBs is freed automatically.  Do <em>not</em> pass the pointers returned
;  from [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into
;  [sqlite3_free()].
; 
;  ^(If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
;  of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
;  is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
;  pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return
;  [SQLITE_NOMEM].)^

;- Create Or Redefine SQL Functions
;  KEYWORDS: {function creation routines}
;  KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL function}
;  KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL functions}
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^These functions (collectively known as "function creation routines")
;  are used to add SQL functions or aggregates or to redefine the behavior
;  of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The only differences between
;  these routines are the text encoding expected for
;  the second parameter (the name of the function being created)
;  and the presence or absence of a destructor callback for
;  the application data pointer.
; 
;  ^The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
;  function is to be added.  ^If an application uses more than one database
;  connection then application-defined SQL functions must be added
;  to each database connection separately.
; 
;  ^The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created or
;  redefined.  ^The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes in a UTF-8
;  representation, exclusive of the zero-terminator.  ^Note that the name
;  length limit is in UTF-8 bytes, not characters nor UTF-16 bytes.  
;  ^Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
;  will result in [SQLITE_MISUSE] being returned.
; 
;  ^The third parameter (nArg)
;  is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
;  aggregate takes. ^If this parameter is -1, then the SQL function or
;  aggregate may take any number of arguments between 0 and the limit
;  set by [sqlite3_limit]([SQLITE_LIMIT_FUNCTION_ARG]).  If the third
;  parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is
;  undefined.
; 
;  ^The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what
;  [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
;  its parameters.  The application should set this parameter to
;  [SQLITE_UTF16LE] if the function implementation invokes 
;  [sqlite3_value_text16le()] on an input, or [SQLITE_UTF16BE] if the
;  implementation invokes [sqlite3_value_text16be()] on an input, or
;  [SQLITE_UTF16] if [sqlite3_value_text16()] is used, or [SQLITE_UTF8]
;  otherwise.  ^The same SQL function may be registered multiple times using
;  different preferred text encodings, with different implementations for
;  each encoding.
;  ^When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
;  will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
; 
;  ^The fourth parameter may optionally be ORed with [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC]
;  to signal that the function will always return the same result given
;  the same inputs within a single SQL statement.  Most SQL functions are
;  deterministic.  The built-in [random()] SQL function is an example of a
;  function that is not deterministic.  The SQLite query planner is able to
;  perform additional optimizations on deterministic functions, so use
;  of the [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC] flag is recommended where possible.
; 
;  ^(The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
;  function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite3_user_data()].)^
; 
;  ^The sixth, seventh and eighth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
;  pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
;  aggregate. ^A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
;  callback only; NULL pointers must be passed as the xStep and xFinal
;  parameters. ^An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
;  and xFinal and NULL pointer must be passed for xFunc. ^To delete an existing
;  SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL pointers for all three function
;  callbacks.
; 
;  ^(If the ninth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2() is not NULL,
;  then it is destructor for the application data pointer. 
;  The destructor is invoked when the function is deleted, either by being
;  overloaded or when the database connection closes.)^
;  ^The destructor is also invoked if the call to
;  sqlite3_create_function_v2() fails.
;  ^When the destructor callback of the tenth parameter is invoked, it
;  is passed a single argument which is a copy of the application data 
;  pointer which was the fifth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2().
; 
;  ^It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
;  functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
;  arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  ^SQLite will use
;  the implementation that most closely matches the way in which the
;  SQL function is used.  ^A function implementation with a non-negative
;  nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
;  a negative nArg.  ^A function where the preferred text encoding
;  matches the database encoding is a better
;  match than a function where the encoding is different.  
;  ^A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
;  is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
;  between UTF8 and UTF16.
; 
;  ^Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
; 
;  ^An application-defined function is permitted to call other
;  SQLite interfaces.  However, such calls must not
;  close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared
;  statement in which the function is running.

;- Obtaining SQL Values
;  METHOD: sqlite3_value
; 
;  The C-language implementation of SQL functions and aggregates uses
;  this set of interface routines to access the parameter values on
;  the function or aggregate.  
; 
;  The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
;  to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
;  define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
;  The 3rd parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
;  [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
;  each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
;  extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
; 
;  These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
;  Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
;  object results in undefined behavior.
; 
;  ^These routines work just like the corresponding [column access functions]
;  except that these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object
;  pointer instead of a [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF-16 string
;  in the native byte-order of the host machine.  ^The
;  sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
;  extract UTF-16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
; 
;  ^(The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
;  numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
;  made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
;  such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
;  words, if the value is a string that looks like a number)
;  then the conversion is performed.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.
;  The [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.)^
; 
;  Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer returned
;  from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or
;  [sqlite3_value_text16()] can be invalidated by a subsequent call to
;  [sqlite3_value_bytes()], [sqlite3_value_bytes16()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
;  or [sqlite3_value_text16()].
;

;- Obtain Aggregate Function Context
;  METHOD: sqlite3_context
; 
;  Implementations of aggregate SQL functions use this
;  routine to allocate memory for storing their state.
; 
;  ^The first time the sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) routine is called 
;  for a particular aggregate function, SQLite

;  to the new memory. ^On second and subsequent calls to
;  sqlite3_aggregate_context() for the same aggregate function instance,
;  the same buffer is returned.  Sqlite3_aggregate_context() is normally
;  called once for each invocation of the xStep callback and then one
;  last time when the xFinal callback is invoked.  ^(When no rows match
;  an aggregate query, the xStep() callback of the aggregate function
;  implementation is never called and xFinal() is called exactly once.
;  In those cases, sqlite3_aggregate_context() might be called for the
;  first time from within xFinal().)^
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) routine returns a NULL pointer 
;  when first called if N is less than or equal to zero or if a memory
;  allocate error occurs.
; 
;  ^(The amount of space allocated by sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) is
;  determined by the N parameter on first successful call.  Changing the
;  value of N in subsequent call to sqlite3_aggregate_context() within
;  the same aggregate function instance will not resize the memory
;  allocation.)^  Within the xFinal callback, it is customary to set
;  N=0 in calls to sqlite3_aggregate_context(C,N) so that no 
;  pointless memory allocations occur.
; 
;  ^SQLite automatically frees the memory allocated by 
;  sqlite3_aggregate_context() when the aggregate query concludes.

;- Function Auxiliary Data
;  METHOD: sqlite3_context
; 
;  These functions may be used by (non-aggregate) SQL functions to
;  associate metadata with argument values. If the same value is passed to
;  multiple invocations of the same SQL function during query execution, under
;  some circumstances the associated metadata may be preserved.  An example
;  of where this might be useful is in a regular-expression matching
;  function. The compiled version of the regular expression can be stored as
;  metadata associated with the pattern string.  
;  Then as long as the pattern string remains the same,
;  the compiled regular expression can be reused on multiple
;  invocations of the same function.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_get_auxdata() interface returns a pointer to the metadata
;  associated by the sqlite3_set_auxdata() function with the Nth argument
;  value to the application-defined function. ^If there is no metadata
;  associated with the function argument, this sqlite3_get_auxdata() interface
;  returns a NULL pointer.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) interface saves P as metadata for the N-th
;  argument of the application-defined function.  ^Subsequent
;  calls to sqlite3_get_auxdata(C,N) return P from the most recent
;  sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) call if the metadata is still valid or
;  NULL if the metadata has been discarded.
;  ^After each call to sqlite3_set_auxdata(C,N,P,X) where X is not NULL,
;  SQLite will invoke the destructor function X with parameter P exactly
;  once, when the metadata is discarded.
;  SQLite is free to discard the metadata at any time, including: <ul>
;  <li> ^(when the corresponding function parameter changes)^, or
;  <li> ^(when [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] is called for the
;       SQL statement)^, or
;  <li> ^(when sqlite3_set_auxdata() is invoked again on the same
;        parameter)^, or

;  sqlite3_set_auxdata() interface even returns.  Hence sqlite3_set_auxdata()
;  should be called near the end of the function implementation and the
;  function implementation should not make any use of P after
;  sqlite3_set_auxdata() has been called.
; 
;  ^(In practice, metadata is preserved between function calls for
;  function parameters that are compile-time constants, including literal

;- Setting The Result Of An SQL Function

;  for additional information.
; 
;  These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of
;  functions used to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
;  Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_zeroblob(C,N) and sqlite3_result_zeroblob64(C,N)
;  interfaces set the result of the application-defined function to be

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
;  an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
;  by its 2nd argument.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
;  cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
;  ^SQLite uses the string pointed to by the

;  message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. ^SQLite
;  interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF-16 in native
;  byte order.  ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
;  or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
;  message all text up through the first zero character.
;  ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
;  sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
;  bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
;  ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
;  routines make a private copy of the error message text before
;  they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
;  modify the text after they return without harm.
;  ^The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
;  returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  ^By default,
;  the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  ^A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_error_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),

;  ^The sqlite3_result_text64() interface sets the return value of an

;  of [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16], [SQLITE_UTF16BE], or [SQLITE_UTF16LE].
;  ^SQLite takes the text result from the application from

;  must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would
;  appear if the string where NUL terminated.  If any NUL characters occur
;  in the string at a byte offset that is less than the value of the 3rd
;  parameter, then the resulting string will contain embedded NULs and the
;  result of expressions operating on strings with embedded NULs is undefined.
;  ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
;  or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that

;  finished using that result.
;  ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or to
;  sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then SQLite
;  assumes that the text or BLOB result is in constant space and does not
;  copy the content of the parameter nor call a destructor on the content
;  when it has finished using that result.
;  ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
;  or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_TRANSIENT
;  then SQLite makes a copy of the result into space obtained from

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_result_value() interface sets the result of

;  ^A [protected sqlite3_value] object may always be used where an

;  higher order bits are discarded.

;- Define New Collating Sequences
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^These functions add, remove, or modify a [collation] associated
;  with the [database connection] specified as the first argument.
; 
;  ^The name of the collation is a UTF-8 string
;  for sqlite3_create_collation() and sqlite3_create_collation_v2()
;  and a UTF-16 string in native byte order for sqlite3_create_collation16().
;  ^Collation names that compare equal according to [sqlite3_strnicmp()] are
;  considered to be the same name.
; 
;  ^(The third argument (eTextRep) must be one of the constants:
;  <ul>
;  <li> [SQLITE_UTF8],
;  <li> [SQLITE_UTF16LE],
;  <li> [SQLITE_UTF16BE],
;  <li> [SQLITE_UTF16], or
;  <li> [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED].
;  </ul>)^
;  ^The eTextRep argument determines the encoding of strings passed
;  to the collating function callback, xCallback.
;  ^The [SQLITE_UTF16] and [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] values for eTextRep
;  force strings to be UTF16 with native byte order.
;  ^The [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] value for eTextRep forces strings to begin
;  on an even byte address.
; 
;  ^The fourth argument, pArg, is an application data pointer that is passed
;  through as the first argument to the collating function callback.
; 
;  ^The fifth argument, xCallback, is a pointer to the collating function.
;  ^Multiple collating functions can be registered using the same name but
;  with different eTextRep parameters and SQLite will use whichever
;  function requires the least amount of data transformation.
;  ^If the xCallback argument is NULL then the collating function is
;  deleted.  ^When all collating functions having the same name are deleted,
;  that collation is no longer usable.
; 
;  ^The collating function callback is invoked with a copy of the pArg 
;  application data pointer and with two strings in the encoding specified
;  by the eTextRep argument.  The collating function must return an
;  integer that is negative, zero, or positive
;  if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second,
;  respectively.  A collating function must always return the same answer
;  given the same inputs.  If two or more collating functions are registered
;  to the same collation name (using different eTextRep values) then all
;  must give an equivalent answer when invoked with equivalent strings.
;  The collating function must obey the following properties for all
;  strings A, B, and C:
; 
;  <ol>
;  <li> If A==B then B==A.
;  <li> If A==B and B==C then A==C.
;  <li> If A&lt;B THEN B&gt;A.
;  <li> If A&lt;B and B&lt;C then A&lt;C.
;  </ol>
; 
;  If a collating function fails any of the above constraints and that
;  collating function is  registered and used, then the behavior of SQLite
;  is undefined.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
;  with the addition that the xDestroy callback is invoked on pArg when
;  the collating function is deleted.
;  ^Collating functions are deleted when they are overridden by later
;  calls to the collation creation functions or when the
;  [database connection] is closed using [sqlite3_close()].
; 
;  ^The xDestroy callback is <u>not</u> called if the 
;  sqlite3_create_collation_v2() function fails.  Applications that invoke
;  sqlite3_create_collation_v2() with a non-NULL xDestroy argument should 
;  check the return code and dispose of the application data pointer
;  themselves rather than expecting SQLite to deal with it for them.
;  This is different from every other SQLite interface.  The inconsistency 
;  is unfortunate but cannot be changed without breaking backwards 
;  compatibility.
;

;- Collation Needed Callbacks
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^To avoid having to register all collation sequences before a database
;  can be used, a single callback function may be registered with the
;  [database connection] to be invoked whenever an undefined collation
;  sequence is required.
; 
;  ^If the function is registered using the sqlite3_collation_needed() API,
;  then it is passed the names of undefined collation sequences as strings
;  encoded in UTF-8. ^If sqlite3_collation_needed16() is used,
;  the names are passed as UTF-16 in machine native byte order.
;  ^A call to either function replaces the existing collation-needed callback.
; 
;  ^(When the callback is invoked, the first argument passed is a copy
;  of the second argument to sqlite3_collation_needed() or
;  sqlite3_collation_needed16().  The second argument is the database
;  connection.  The third argument is one of [SQLITE_UTF8], [SQLITE_UTF16BE],
;  or [SQLITE_UTF16LE], indicating the most desirable form of the collation
;  sequence function required.  The fourth parameter is the name of the
;  required collation sequence.)^
; 
;  The callback function should register the desired collation using
;  [sqlite3_create_collation()], [sqlite3_create_collation16()], or
;  [sqlite3_create_collation_v2()].

;  function to be invoked whenever a transaction is [ROLLBACK | rolled back].
;  ^Any callback set by a previous call to sqlite3_rollback_hook()
;  for the same database connection is overridden.
;  ^The pArg argument is passed through to the callback.

; 
;  ^The sqlite3_commit_hook(D,C,P) and sqlite3_rollback_hook(D,C,P) functions

; 
;  The commit and rollback hook callbacks are not reentrant.
;  The callback implementation must not do anything that will modify
;  the database connection that invoked the callback.  Any actions
;  to modify the database connection must be deferred until after the
;  completion of the [sqlite3_step()] call that triggered the commit
;  or rollback hook in the first place.
;  Note that running any other SQL statements, including SELECT statements,

;  the database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
; 
;  ^Registering a NULL function disables the callback.

;  ^The rollback hook is invoked on a rollback that results from a commit
;  hook returning non-zero, just as it would be with any other rollback.
; 
;  ^For the purposes of this API, a transaction is said to have been
;  rolled back if an explicit "ROLLBACK" statement is executed, or
;  an error or constraint causes an implicit rollback to occur.
;  ^The rollback callback is not invoked if a transaction is
;  automatically rolled back because the database connection is closed.

;- Impose A Limit On Heap Size
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() interface sets and/or queries the
;  soft limit on the amount of heap memory that may be allocated by SQLite.
;  ^SQLite strives to keep heap memory utilization below the soft heap
;  limit by reducing the number of pages held in the page cache
;  as heap memory usages approaches the limit.
;  ^The soft heap limit is "soft" because even though SQLite strives to stay
;  below the limit, it will exceed the limit rather than generate
;  an [SQLITE_NOMEM] error.  In other words, the soft heap limit 
;  is advisory only.
; 
;  ^The return value from sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() is the size of
;  the soft heap limit prior to the call, or negative in the case of an
;  error.  ^If the argument N is negative
;  then no change is made to the soft heap limit.  Hence, the current
;  size of the soft heap limit can be determined by invoking
;  sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() with a negative argument.
; 
;  ^If the argument N is zero then the soft heap limit is disabled.
; 
;  ^(The soft heap limit is not enforced in the current implementation
;  if one or more of following conditions are true:
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li> The soft heap limit is set to zero.
;  <li> Memory accounting is disabled using a combination of the
;       [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS],...) start-time option and
;       the [SQLITE_DEFAULT_MEMSTATUS] compile-time option.
;  <li> An alternative page cache implementation is specified using
;       [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2],...).
;  <li> The page cache allocates from its own memory pool supplied
;       by [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE],...) rather than
;       from the heap.
;  </ul>)^
; 
;  Beginning with SQLite [version 3.7.3] ([dateof:3.7.3]), 
;  the soft heap limit is enforced
;  regardless of whether or not the [SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT]
;  compile-time option is invoked.  With [SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT],
;  the soft heap limit is enforced on every memory allocation.  Without
;  [SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT], the soft heap limit is only enforced
;  when memory is allocated by the page cache.  Testing suggests that because
;  the page cache is the predominate memory user in SQLite, most
;  applications will achieve adequate soft heap limit enforcement without
;  the use of [SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT].
; 
;  The circumstances under which SQLite will enforce the soft heap limit may
;  changes in future releases of SQLite.

;  So for example, if "samplelib" cannot be loaded, then names like
;  "samplelib.so" or "samplelib.dylib" or "samplelib.dll" might
;  be tried also.
; 
;  ^The entry point is zProc.
;  ^(zProc may be 0, in which case SQLite will try to come up with an
;  entry point name on its own.  It first tries "sqlite3_extension_init".
;  If that does not work, it constructs a name "sqlite3_X_init" where the
;  X is consists of the lower-case equivalent of all ASCII alphabetic
;  characters in the filename from the last "/" to the first following
;  "." and omitting any initial "lib".)^
;  ^The sqlite3_load_extension() interface returns
;  [SQLITE_OK] on success and [SQLITE_ERROR] if something goes wrong.
;  ^If an error occurs and pzErrMsg is not 0, then the
;  [sqlite3_load_extension()] interface shall attempt to
;  fill *pzErrMsg with error message text stored in memory

;- Automatically Load Statically Linked Extensions

;- Mutexes
; 
;  The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
;  synchronization. Though they are intended for internal
;  use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
;  permitted to use any of these routines.
; 
;  The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations
;  of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
;  is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
;  implementations are available in the SQLite core:
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS
;  <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
;  <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
;  </ul>
; 
;  The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines
;  that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in
;  a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS and
;  SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations are appropriate for use on Unix
;  and Windows.
; 
;  If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
;  macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
;  implementation is included with the library. In this case the
;  application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
;  [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
;  before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
;  function that calls sqlite3_initialize().
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
;  mutex and returns a pointer to it. ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
;  routine returns NULL if it is unable to allocate the requested
;  mutex.  The argument to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() must one of these
;  integer constants:
; 
;  <ul>
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_OPEN
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PMEM
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP1
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP2
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_APP3
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS1
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS2
;  <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_VFS3
;  </ul>
; 
;  ^The first two constants (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE)
;  cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
;  a new mutex.  ^The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
;  is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
;  The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
;  between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
;  not want to.  SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
;  cases where it really needs one.  If a faster non-recursive mutex
;  implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
;  might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
; 
;  ^The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() (anything other
;  than SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) each return
;  a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  ^Nine static mutexes are
;  used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
;  may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
;  use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
;  use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
;  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
; 
;  ^Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
;  or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
;  returns a different mutex on every call.  ^For the static
;  mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
;  the same type number.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
;  allocated dynamic mutex.  Attempting to deallocate a static
;  mutex results in undefined behavior.
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
;  to enter a mutex.  ^If another thread is already within the mutex,
;  sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
;  SQLITE_BUSY.  ^The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
;  upon successful entry.  ^(Mutexes created using
;  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
;  In such cases, the
;  mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
;  can enter.)^  If the same thread tries to enter any mutex other
;  than an SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE more than once, the behavior is undefined.
; 
;  ^(Some systems (for example, Windows 95) do not support the operation
;  implemented by sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try()
;  will always return SQLITE_BUSY. The SQLite core only ever uses
;  sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable 
;  behavior.)^
; 
;  ^The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
;  previously entered by the same thread.   The behavior

;  are advised to follow the lead of the core.  The SQLite core only
;  provides implementations for these routines when it is compiled
;  with the SQLITE_DEBUG flag.  External mutex implementations
;  are only required to provide these routines if SQLITE_DEBUG is
;  defined and if NDEBUG is not defined.
; 
;  These routines should return true if the mutex in their argument
;  is held or not held, respectively, by the calling thread.
; 
;  The implementation is not required to provide versions of these
;  routines that actually work. If the implementation does not provide working
;  versions of these routines, it should at least provide stubs that always
;  return true so that one does not get spurious assertion failures.
; 
;  If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_held() is a NULL pointer then
;  the routine should return 1.   This seems counter-intuitive since
;  clearly the mutex cannot be held if it does not exist.  But
;  the reason the mutex does not exist is because the build is not
;  using mutexes.  And we do not want the assert() containing the
;  call to sqlite3_mutex_held() to fail, so a non-zero return is
;  the appropriate thing to do.  The sqlite3_mutex_notheld()
;  interface should also return 1 when given a NULL pointer.

;  if the application incorrectly accesses the destination [database connection]
;  and so no error code is reported, but the operations may malfunction
;  nevertheless.  Use of the destination database connection while a
;  backup is in progress might also also cause a mutex deadlock.
; 
;  If running in [shared cache mode], the application must
;  guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
;  is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
;  that the application must guarantee that the disk file being 
;  backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
;  not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().

;- Unlock Notification
;  METHOD: sqlite3
; 
;  ^When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
;  an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
;  individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
;  [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
;  ^This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
;  when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
;  ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
;  [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
; 
;  See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
; 
;  ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
;  its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
; 
;  ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
;  shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
;  identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
;  has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an 
;  application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
;  sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
;  the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
;  when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
;  callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
;  call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
; 
;  ^(If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
;  there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
;  concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
;  If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
;  from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().)^
; 
;  ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
;  shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
;  a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
;  the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
; 
;  ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
;  blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
;  blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
;  then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
;  called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
;  unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections 
;  unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
;  connection using [sqlite3_close()].
; 
;  The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
;  any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
;  crash or deadlock may be the result.
; 
;  ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
;  returns SQLITE_OK.
; 
;  <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
; 
;  When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
;  single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
;  However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
;  it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
;  an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
;  and the second is the number of entries in the array.
; 
;  When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
;  more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
;  callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
;  same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
;  multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
;  specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
;  This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
;  related to the set of unblocked database connections.
; 
;  <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
; 
;  Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
;  database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
;  action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
;  application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
;  connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
;  Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
;  will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
; 
;  To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
;  detection. ^If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
;  system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
;  unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
;  a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
;  callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
;  B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
;  A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
;  the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
;  registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
;  C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
;  number of levels of indirection are allowed.
; 
;  <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
; 
;  When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
;  always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
;  one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
;  SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
;  that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
;  returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
;  sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
;  invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
;  or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
; 
;  One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
;  by an sqlite3_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
;  extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
;  the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
;  SQLITE_LOCKED.)^

;- Write-Ahead Log Commit Hook
;  METHOD: sqlite3
;

;  is invoked each time data is committed to a database in wal mode.
; 
;  ^(The callback is invoked by SQLite after the commit has taken place and

;  may read, write or [checkpoint] the database as required.
; 
;  ^The first parameter passed to the callback function when it is invoked
;  is a copy of the third parameter passed to sqlite3_wal_hook() when
;  registering the callback. ^The second is a copy of the database handle.
;  ^The third parameter is the name of the database that was written to -
;  either "main" or the name of an [ATTACH]-ed database. ^The fourth parameter
;  is the number of pages currently in the write-ahead log file,
;  including those that were just committed.
; 
;  The callback function should normally return [SQLITE_OK].  ^If an error
;  code is returned, that error will propagate back up through the

;  to report an error, though the commit will have still occurred. If the
;  callback returns [SQLITE_ROW] or [SQLITE_DONE], or if it returns a value
;  that does not correspond to any valid SQLite error code, the results
;  are undefined.

; 
;  The following must be true for this function to succeed. If any of
;  the following statements are false when sqlite3_snapshot_get() is

; 
;  If a single row is affected by more than one operation within a session,

;  flag.  If the second argument passed to this function is zero, then the
;  indirect flag is cleared. If it is greater than zero, the indirect flag
;  is set. Passing a value less than zero does not modify the current value
;  of the indirect flag, and may be used to query the current state of the

;- Attach A Table To A Session Object
; 
;  If argument zTab is not NULL, then it is the name of a table to attach
;  to the session object passed as the first argument. All subsequent changes 
;  made to the table while the session object is enabled will be recorded. See 
;  documentation for [sqlite3session_changeset()] for further details.
; 
;  Or, if argument zTab is NULL, then changes are recorded for all tables
;  in the database. If additional tables are added to the database (by 
;  executing "CREATE TABLE" statements) after this call is made, changes for 
;  the new tables are also recorded.
; 
;  Changes can only be recorded for tables that have a PRIMARY KEY explicitly
;  defined as part of their CREATE TABLE statement. It does not matter if the 
;  PRIMARY KEY is an "INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" (rowid alias) or not. The PRIMARY
;  KEY may consist of a single column, or may be a composite key.
;  
;  It is not an error if the named table does not exist in the database. Nor
;  is it an error if the named table does not have a PRIMARY KEY. However,
;  no changes will be recorded in either of these scenarios.
; 
;  Changes are not recorded for individual rows that have NULL values stored
;  in one or more of their PRIMARY KEY columns.
; 
;  SQLITE_OK is returned if the call completes without error. Or, if an error 
;  occurs, an SQLite error code (e.g. SQLITE_NOMEM) is returned.

;- Generate A Changeset From A Session Object
; 
;  Obtain a changeset containing changes to the tables attached to the 
;  session object passed as the first argument. If successful, 
;  set *ppChangeset to point to a buffer containing the changeset 
;  and *pnChangeset to the size of the changeset in bytes before returning
;  SQLITE_OK. If an error occurs, set both *ppChangeset and *pnChangeset to
;  zero and return an SQLite error code.
; 
;  A changeset consists of zero or more INSERT, UPDATE and/or DELETE changes,
;  each representing a change to a single row of an attached table. An INSERT
;  change contains the values of each field of a new database row. A DELETE
;  contains the original values of each field of a deleted database row. An
;  UPDATE change contains the original values of each field of an updated
;  database row along with the updated values for each updated non-primary-key
;  column. It is not possible for an UPDATE change to represent a change that
;  modifies the values of primary key columns. If such a change is made, it
;  is represented in a changeset as a DELETE followed by an INSERT.
; 
;  Changes are not recorded for rows that have NULL values stored in one or 
;  more of their PRIMARY KEY columns. If such a row is inserted or deleted,
;  no corresponding change is present in the changesets returned by this
;  function. If an existing row with one or more NULL values stored in
;  PRIMARY KEY columns is updated so that all PRIMARY KEY columns are non-NULL,
;  only an INSERT is appears in the changeset. Similarly, if an existing row
;  with non-NULL PRIMARY KEY values is updated so that one or more of its
;  PRIMARY KEY columns are set to NULL, the resulting changeset contains a
;  DELETE change only.
; 
;  The contents of a changeset may be traversed using an iterator created
;  using the [sqlite3changeset_start()] API. A changeset may be applied to
;  a database with a compatible schema using the [sqlite3changeset_apply()]
;  API.
; 
;  Within a changeset generated by this function, all changes related to a
;  single table are grouped together. In other words, when iterating through
;  a changeset or when applying a changeset to a database, all changes related
;  to a single table are processed before moving on to the next table. Tables
;  are sorted in the same order in which they were attached (or auto-attached)
;  to the sqlite3_session object. The order in which the changes related to
;  a single table are stored is undefined.
; 
;  Following a successful call to this function, it is the responsibility of
;  the caller to eventually free the buffer that *ppChangeset points to using
;  [sqlite3_free()].

;  Once a table has been attached to a session object, the session object
;  records the primary key values of all new rows inserted into the table.
;  It also records the original primary key and other column values of any
;  deleted or updated rows. For each unique primary key value, data is only
;  recorded once - the first time a row with said primary key is inserted,
;  updated or deleted in the lifetime of the session.
; 
;  There is one exception to the previous paragraph: when a row is inserted,
;  updated or deleted, if one or more of its primary key columns contain a
;  NULL value, no record of the change is made.
; 
;  The session object therefore accumulates two types of records - those
;  that consist of primary key values only (created when the user inserts
;  a new record) and those that consist of the primary key values and the
;  original values of other table columns (created when the users deletes
;  or updates a record).
; 
;  When this function is called, the requested changeset is created using
;  both the accumulated records and the current contents of the database
;  file. Specifically:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> For each record generated by an insert, the database is queried
;         for a row with a matching primary key. If one is found, an INSERT
;         change is added to the changeset. If no such row is found, no change 
;         is added to the changeset.
; 
;    <li> For each record generated by an update or delete, the database is 
;         queried for a row with a matching primary key. If such a row is
;         found and one or more of the non-primary key fields have been
;         modified from their original values, an UPDATE change is added to 
;         the changeset. Or, if no such row is found in the table, a DELETE 
;         change is added to the changeset. If there is a row with a matching
;         primary key in the database, but all fields contain their original
;         values, no change is added to the changeset.
;  </ul>
; 
;  This means, amongst other things, that if a row is inserted and then later
;  deleted while a session object is active, neither the insert nor the delete
;  will be present in the changeset. Or if a row is deleted and then later a 
;  row with the same primary key values inserted while a session object is
;  active, the resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change instead of
;  a DELETE and an INSERT.
; 
;  When a session object is disabled (see the [sqlite3session_enable()] API),
;  it does not accumulate records when rows are inserted, updated or deleted.
;  This may appear to have some counter-intuitive effects if a single row
;  is written to more than once during a session. For example, if a row
;  is inserted while a session object is enabled, then later deleted while 
;  the same session object is disabled, no INSERT record will appear in the
;  changeset, even though the delete took place while the session was disabled.
;  Or, if one field of a row is updated while a session is disabled, and 
;  another field of the same row is updated while the session is enabled, the
;  resulting changeset will contain an UPDATE change that updates both fields.

;- Load The Difference Between Tables Into A Session 
; 
;  If it is not already attached to the session object passed as the first
;  argument, this function attaches table zTbl in the same manner as the
;  [sqlite3session_attach()] function. If zTbl does not exist, or if it
;  does not have a primary key, this function is a no-op (but does not return
;  an error).
; 
;  Argument zFromDb must be the name of a database ("main", "temp" etc.)
;  attached to the same database handle as the session object that contains 
;  a table compatible with the table attached to the session by this function.
;  A table is considered compatible if it:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> Has the same name,
;    <li> Has the same set of columns declared in the same order, and
;    <li> Has the same PRIMARY KEY definition.
;  </ul>
; 
;  If the tables are not compatible, SQLITE_SCHEMA is returned. If the tables
;  are compatible but do not have any PRIMARY KEY columns, it is not an error
;  but no changes are added to the session object. As with other session
;  APIs, tables without PRIMARY KEYs are simply ignored.
; 
;  This function adds a set of changes to the session object that could be
;  used to update the table in database zFrom (call this the "from-table") 
;  so that its content is the same as the table attached to the session 
;  object (call this the "to-table"). Specifically:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in 
;      the from-table, an INSERT record is added to the session object.
; 
;    <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in the to-table but not in 
;      the from-table, a DELETE record is added to the session object.
; 
;    <li> For each row (primary key) that exists in both tables, but features 
;      different non-PK values in each, an UPDATE record is added to the
;      session.  
;  </ul>
; 
;  To clarify, if this function is called and then a changeset constructed
;  using [sqlite3session_changeset()], then after applying that changeset to 
;  database zFrom the contents of the two compatible tables would be 
;  identical.
; 
;  It an error if database zFrom does not exist or does not contain the
;  required compatible table.
; 
;  If the operation successful, SQLITE_OK is returned. Otherwise, an SQLite
;  error code. In this case, if argument pzErrMsg is not NULL, *pzErrMsg
;  may be set to point to a buffer containing an English language error 
;  message. It is the responsibility of the caller to free this buffer using
;  sqlite3_free().

;- Generate A Patchset From A Session Object
; 
;  The differences between a patchset and a changeset are that:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> DELETE records consist of the primary key fields only. The 
;         original values of other fields are omitted.
;    <li> The original values of any modified fields are omitted from 
;         UPDATE records.
;  </ul>
; 
;  A patchset blob may be used with up to date versions of all 
;  sqlite3changeset_xxx API functions except for sqlite3changeset_invert(), 
;  which returns SQLITE_CORRUPT if it is passed a patchset. Similarly,
;  attempting to use a patchset blob with old versions of the
;  sqlite3changeset_xxx APIs also provokes an SQLITE_CORRUPT error. 
; 
;  Because the non-primary key "old.*" fields are omitted, no 
;  SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflicts can be detected or reported if a patchset
;  is passed to the sqlite3changeset_apply() API. Other conflict types work
;  in the same way as for changesets.
; 
;  Changes within a patchset are ordered in the same way as for changesets
;  generated by the sqlite3session_changeset() function (i.e. all changes for
;  a single table are grouped together, tables appear in the order in which
;  they were attached to the session object).

;- Test if a changeset has recorded any changes.
; 
;  Return non-zero if no changes to attached tables have been recorded by 
;  the session object passed as the first argument. Otherwise, if one or 
;  more changes have been recorded, return zero.
; 
;  Even if this function returns zero, it is possible that calling
;  [sqlite3session_changeset()] on the session handle may still return a
;  changeset that contains no changes. This can happen when a row in 
;  an attached table is modified and then later on the original values 
;  are restored. However, if this function returns non-zero, then it is
;  guaranteed that a call to sqlite3session_changeset() will return a 
;  changeset containing zero changes.

;- Create An Iterator To Traverse A Changeset 
; 
;  Create an iterator used to iterate through the contents of a changeset.
;  If successful, *pp is set to point to the iterator handle and SQLITE_OK
;  is returned. Otherwise, if an error occurs, *pp is set to zero and an
;  SQLite error code is returned.
; 
;  The following functions can be used to advance and query a changeset 
;  iterator created by this function:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> [sqlite3changeset_next()]
;    <li> [sqlite3changeset_op()]
;    <li> [sqlite3changeset_new()]
;    <li> [sqlite3changeset_old()]
;  </ul>
; 
;  It is the responsibility of the caller to eventually destroy the iterator
;  by passing it to [sqlite3changeset_finalize()]. The buffer containing the
;  changeset (pChangeset) must remain valid until after the iterator is
;  destroyed.
; 
;  Assuming the changeset blob was created by one of the
;  [sqlite3session_changeset()], [sqlite3changeset_concat()] or
;  [sqlite3changeset_invert()] functions, all changes within the changeset 
;  that apply to a single table are grouped together. This means that when 
;  an application iterates through a changeset using an iterator created by 
;  this function, all changes that relate to a single table are visited 
;  consecutively. There is no chance that the iterator will visit a change 
;  the applies to table X, then one for table Y, and then later on visit 
;  another change for table X.

;- Advance A Changeset Iterator
; 
;  This function may only be used with iterators created by function
;  [sqlite3changeset_start()]. If it is called on an iterator passed to
;  a conflict-handler callback by [sqlite3changeset_apply()], SQLITE_MISUSE
;  is returned and the call has no effect.
; 
;  Immediately after an iterator is created by sqlite3changeset_start(), it
;  does not point to any change in the changeset. Assuming the changeset
;  is not empty, the first call to this function advances the iterator to
;  point to the first change in the changeset. Each subsequent call advances
;  the iterator to point to the next change in the changeset (if any). If
;  no error occurs and the iterator points to a valid change after a call
;  to sqlite3changeset_next() has advanced it, SQLITE_ROW is returned. 
;  Otherwise, if all changes in the changeset have already been visited,
;  SQLITE_DONE is returned.
; 
;  If an error occurs, an SQLite error code is returned. Possible error 
;  codes include SQLITE_CORRUPT (if the changeset buffer is corrupt) or 
;  SQLITE_NOMEM.

;- Obtain The Current Operation From A Changeset Iterator
; 
;  The pIter argument passed to this function may either be an iterator
;  passed to a conflict-handler by [sqlite3changeset_apply()], or an iterator
;  created by [sqlite3changeset_start()]. In the latter case, the most recent

;  is not the case, this function returns [SQLITE_MISUSE].
; 
;  If argument pzTab is not NULL, then *pzTab is set to point to a
;  nul-terminated utf-8 encoded string containing the name of the table
;  affected by the current change. The buffer remains valid until either
;  sqlite3changeset_next() is called on the iterator or until the 
;  conflict-handler function returns. If pnCol is not NULL, then *pnCol is 
;  set to the number of columns in the table affected by the change. If
;  pbIncorrect is not NULL, then *pbIndirect is set to true (1) if the change
;  is an indirect change, or false (0) otherwise. See the documentation for
;  [sqlite3session_indirect()] for a description of direct and indirect
;  changes. Finally, if pOp is not NULL, then *pOp is set to one of 
;  [SQLITE_INSERT], [SQLITE_DELETE] or [SQLITE_UPDATE], depending on the 
;  type of change that the iterator currently points to.
; 
;  If no error occurs, SQLITE_OK is returned. If an error does occur, an

;- Obtain The Primary Key Definition Of A Table

;- Invert A Changeset
; 
;  This function is used to "invert" a changeset object. Applying an inverted
;  changeset to a database reverses the effects of applying the uninverted
;  changeset. Specifically:

;  <ul>
;    <li> Each DELETE change is changed to an INSERT, and
;    <li> Each INSERT change is changed to a DELETE, and
;    <li> For each UPDATE change, the old.* and new.* values are exchanged.
;  </ul>
; 
;  This function does not change the order in which changes appear within
;  the changeset. It merely reverses the sense of each individual change.
; 
;  If successful, a pointer to a buffer containing the inverted changeset
;  is stored in *ppOut, the size of the same buffer is stored in *pnOut, and
;  SQLITE_OK is returned. If an error occurs, both *pnOut and *ppOut are
;  zeroed and an SQLite error code returned.
; 
;  It is the responsibility of the caller to eventually call sqlite3_free()
;  on the *ppOut pointer to free the buffer allocation following a successful

;- Concatenate Two Changeset Objects
; 
;  This function is used to concatenate two changesets, A and B, into a 
;  single changeset. The result is a changeset equivalent to applying
;  changeset A followed by changeset B. 
; 
;  This function combines the two input changesets using an 
;  sqlite3_changegroup object. Calling it produces similar results as the
;  following code fragment:
; 
;    sqlite3_changegroup *pGrp;
;    rc = sqlite3_changegroup_new(&pGrp);
;    if( rc==SQLITE_OK ) rc = sqlite3changegroup_add(pGrp, nA, pA);
;    if( rc==SQLITE_OK ) rc = sqlite3changegroup_add(pGrp, nB, pB);
;    if( rc==SQLITE_OK ){
;      rc = sqlite3changegroup_output(pGrp, pnOut, ppOut);
;    }else{
;      *ppOut = 0;
;      *pnOut = 0;
;    }
; 
;  Refer to the sqlite3_changegroup documentation below for details.

;- Apply A Changeset To A Database
; 
;  Apply a changeset to a database. This function attempts to update the
;  "main" database attached to handle db with the changes found in the
;  changeset passed via the second and third arguments.
; 
;  The fourth argument (xFilter) passed to this function is the "filter
;  callback". If it is not NULL, then for each table affected by at least one
;  change in the changeset, the filter callback is invoked with
;  the table name as the second argument, and a copy of the context pointer
;  passed as the sixth argument to this function as the first. If the "filter
;  callback" returns zero, then no attempt is made to apply any changes to 
;  the table. Otherwise, if the return value is non-zero or the xFilter
;  argument to this function is NULL, all changes related to the table are
;  attempted.
; 
;  For each table that is not excluded by the filter callback, this function 
;  tests that the target database contains a compatible table. A table is 
;  considered compatible if all of the following are true:
; 
;  <ul>
;    <li> The table has the same name as the name recorded in the 
;         changeset, and
;    <li> The table has at least as many columns as recorded in the 
;         changeset, and
;    <li> The table has primary key columns in the same position as 
;         recorded in the changeset.
;  </ul>
; 
;  If there is no compatible table, it is not an error, but none of the
;  changes associated with the table are applied. A warning message is issued
;  via the sqlite3_log() mechanism with the error code SQLITE_SCHEMA. At most
;  one such warning is issued for each table in the changeset.
; 
;  For each change for which there is a compatible table, an attempt is made 
;  to modify the table contents according to the UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE 
;  change. If a change cannot be applied cleanly, the conflict handler 
;  function passed as the fifth argument to sqlite3changeset_apply() may be 
;  invoked. A description of exactly when the conflict handler is invoked for 
;  each type of change is below.
; 
;  Unlike the xFilter argument, xConflict may not be passed NULL. The results
;  of passing anything other than a valid function pointer as the xConflict
;  argument are undefined.
; 
;  Each time the conflict handler function is invoked, it must return one
;  of [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT], [SQLITE_CHANGESET_ABORT] or 
;  [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE]. SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE may only be returned
;  if the second argument passed to the conflict handler is either
;  SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA or SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT. If the conflict-handler
;  returns an illegal value, any changes already made are rolled back and
;  the call to sqlite3changeset_apply() returns SQLITE_MISUSE. Different 
;  actions are taken by sqlite3changeset_apply() depending on the value
;  returned by each invocation of the conflict-handler function. Refer to
;  the documentation for the three 
;  [SQLITE_CHANGESET_OMIT|available return values] for details.
; 
;  <dl>
;  <dt>DELETE Changes<dd>
;    For each DELETE change, this function checks if the target database 
;    contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the 
;    original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values 
;    stored in all non-primary key columns also match the values stored in 
;    the changeset the row is deleted from the target database.
; 
;    If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
;    the non-primary key fields contains a value different from the original
;    row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function is
;    invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. If the
;    database table has more columns than are recorded in the changeset,
;    only the values of those non-primary key fields are compared against
;    the current database contents - any trailing database table columns
;    are ignored.
; 
;    If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
;    the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
;    passed as the second argument.
; 
;    If the DELETE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT
;    (which can only happen if a foreign key constraint is violated), the
;    conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT]
;    passed as the second argument. This includes the case where the DELETE
;    operation is attempted because an earlier call to the conflict handler
;    function returned [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
; 
;  <dt>INSERT Changes<dd>
;    For each INSERT change, an attempt is made to insert the new row into
;    the database. If the changeset row contains fewer fields than the
;    database table, the trailing fields are populated with their default
;    values.
; 
;    If the attempt to insert the row fails because the database already 
;    contains a row with the same primary key values, the conflict handler
;    function is invoked with the second argument set to 
;    [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONFLICT].
; 
;    If the attempt to insert the row fails because of some other constraint
;    violation (e.g. NOT NULL or UNIQUE), the conflict handler function is 
;    invoked with the second argument set to [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT].
;    This includes the case where the INSERT operation is re-attempted because 
;    an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned 
;    [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].
; 
;  <dt>UPDATE Changes<dd>
;    For each UPDATE change, this function checks if the target database 
;    contains a row with the same primary key value (or values) as the 
;    original row values stored in the changeset. If it does, and the values 
;    stored in all modified non-primary key columns also match the values
;    stored in the changeset the row is updated within the target database.
; 
;    If a row with matching primary key values is found, but one or more of
;    the modified non-primary key fields contains a value different from an
;    original row value stored in the changeset, the conflict-handler function
;    is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA] as the second argument. Since
;    UPDATE changes only contain values for non-primary key fields that are
;    to be modified, only those fields need to match the original values to
;    avoid the SQLITE_CHANGESET_DATA conflict-handler callback.
; 
;    If no row with matching primary key values is found in the database,
;    the conflict-handler function is invoked with [SQLITE_CHANGESET_NOTFOUND]
;    passed as the second argument.
; 
;    If the UPDATE operation is attempted, but SQLite returns 
;    SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the conflict-handler function is invoked with 
;    [SQLITE_CHANGESET_CONSTRAINT] passed as the second argument.
;    This includes the case where the UPDATE operation is attempted after 
;    an earlier call to the conflict handler function returned
;    [SQLITE_CHANGESET_REPLACE].  
;  </dl>
; 
;  It is safe to execute SQL statements, including those that write to the
;  table that the callback related to, from within the xConflict callback.
;  This can be used to further customize the applications conflict
;  resolution strategy.
; 
;  All changes made by this function are enclosed in a savepoint transaction.
;  If any other error (aside from a constraint failure when attempting to
;  write to the target database) occurs, then the savepoint transaction is
;  rolled back, restoring the target database to its original state, and an 
;  SQLite error code returned.

;- Streaming Versions of API functions.
; 
;  The six streaming API xxx_strm() functions serve similar purposes to the 
;  corresponding non-streaming API functions:
; 
;  <table border=1 style="margin-left:8ex;margin-right:8ex">
;    <tr><th>Streaming function<th>Non-streaming equivalent</th>
;    <tr><td>sqlite3changeset_apply_str<td>[sqlite3changeset_apply] 
;    <tr><td>sqlite3changeset_concat_str<td>[sqlite3changeset_concat] 
;    <tr><td>sqlite3changeset_invert_str<td>[sqlite3changeset_invert] 
;    <tr><td>sqlite3changeset_start_str<td>[sqlite3changeset_start] 
;    <tr><td>sqlite3session_changeset_str<td>[sqlite3session_changeset] 
;    <tr><td>sqlite3session_patchset_str<td>[sqlite3session_patchset] 
;  </table>
; 
;  Non-streaming functions that accept changesets (or patchsets) as input
;  require that the entire changeset be stored in a single buffer in memory. 
;  Similarly, those that return a changeset or patchset do so by returning 
;  a pointer to a single large buffer allocated using sqlite3_malloc(). 
;  Normally this is convenient. However, if an application running in a 
;  low-memory environment is required to handle very large changesets, the
;  large contiguous memory allocations required can become onerous.
; 
;  In order to avoid this problem, instead of a single large buffer, input
;  is passed to a streaming API functions by way of a callback function that
;  the sessions module invokes to incrementally request input data as it is
;  required. In all cases, a pair of API function parameters such as
; 
;   <pre>
;   &nbsp;     int nChangeset,
;   &nbsp;     void *pChangeset,
;   </pre>
; 
;  Is replaced by:
; 
;   <pre>
;   &nbsp;     int (*xInput)(void *pIn, void *pData, int *pnData),
;   &nbsp;     void *pIn,
;   </pre>
; 
;  Each time the xInput callback is invoked by the sessions module, the first
;  argument passed is a copy of the supplied pIn context pointer. The second 
;  argument, pData, points to a buffer (*pnData) bytes in size. Assuming no 
;  error occurs the xInput method should copy up to (*pnData) bytes of data 
;  into the buffer and set (*pnData) to the actual number of bytes copied 
;  before returning SQLITE_OK. If the input is completely exhausted, (*pnData) 
;  should be set to zero to indicate this. Or, if an error occurs, an SQLite 
;  error code should be returned. In all cases, if an xInput callback returns
;  an error, all processing is abandoned and the streaming API function
;  returns a copy of the error code to the caller.
; 
;  In the case of sqlite3changeset_start_strm(), the xInput callback may be
;  invoked by the sessions module at any point during the lifetime of the
;  iterator. If such an xInput callback returns an error, the iterator enters
;  an error state, whereby all subsequent calls to iterator functions 
;  immediately fail with the same error code as returned by xInput.
; 
;  Similarly, streaming API functions that return changesets (or patchsets)
;  return them in chunks by way of a callback function instead of via a
;  pointer to a single large buffer. In this case, a pair of parameters such
;  as:
; 
;   <pre>
;   &nbsp;     int *pnChangeset,
;   &nbsp;     void **ppChangeset,
;   </pre>
; 
;  Is replaced by:
; 
;   <pre>
;   &nbsp;     int (*xOutput)(void *pOut, const void *pData, int nData),
;   &nbsp;     void *pOut
;   </pre>
; 
;  The xOutput callback is invoked zero or more times to return data to
;  the application. The first parameter passed to each call is a copy of the
;  pOut pointer supplied by the application. The second parameter, pData,
;  points to a buffer nData bytes in size containing the chunk of output
;  data being returned. If the xOutput callback successfully processes the
;  supplied data, it should return SQLITE_OK to indicate success. Otherwise,
;  it should return some other SQLite error code. In this case processing
;  is immediately abandoned and the streaming API function returns a copy
;  of the xOutput error code to the application.
; 
;  The sessions module never invokes an xOutput callback with the third 
;  parameter set to a value less than or equal to zero. Other than this,
;  no guarantees are made as to the size of the chunks of data returned.
