; A number of languages have `take-while/drop-while` funcs. This is just to show how you
; can build them in Red.

; This model can be applied to any function that has a `/part` refinement, or extended in
; any number of ways. We don't yet have a standard `apply` or `refine` function in Red.
; Once we do, a more general HOF version could take the action as an arg, as well as the
; test to apply.

; Should this return the position, like FIND, rather than an integer?
; No match would then mean a NONE result. REMOVE/TAKE/COPY with /PART
; then means using INDEX?.
