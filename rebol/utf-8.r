    Name: "UTF-8"
    Version: 1.0.2
    File: %utf-8.r
    Author: "Jan Skibinski"
    Needs: [%hof.r]
    Purpose: {Encoding and decoding of UCS strings
to and from UTF-8 strings.
}
    History: {
    Version 1.0.2: Added a simulation of a Unicode support.
    Version 1.0.1:
        A full range of optimizations has been applied,
        resulting in much improved speed. The entire scheme
        has been redesigned and the algorithms simplified.
        Most of the data tables have been removed.
        There are fewer functions but they are more generic.

    Version 1.0.0:
        Basic UTF-8 encoding and decoding functions.
        Limitations: Does not handle a big/little endian
        signatures yet. Needs thorough testing and algorithms
        optimalizations.

    Acknowledments: {
        Inspired by the script 'utf8-encode.r of RebOldes
        and Romano Paulo Tenca, which encodes Latin-1 strings.

        I'd like to thank RebOldes for his suggestions for improvements
        regarding the version 1.0.0. However the completely redesigned
        version 1.0.1 was already under way so his changes did not
        make it here.

        My thanks go also to Romano Paulo Tenca for converting
        my 'while loop to a 'parse loop and for a bunch of other
        optimization tricks, such as inlining and "precompilation"
        of fetch functions.

    UCS means: Universal Character Set (or Unicode)
    UCS-2 means: 2-byte representation of a character in UCS.
    UCS-4 means: 4-byte representation of a character in UCS.
    UTF-8 means: UCS Transformation Format using 8-bit octets.


    The following excerpt from:
        UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux, by Markus Kuhn
        http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
    provides motivations for using UTF-8.

    <<Using UCS-2 (or UCS-4) under Unix would lead to very severe
    problems. Strings with these encodings can contain as parts
    of many wide characters bytes like '\0' or '/' which have a
    special meaning in filenames and other C library function
    parameters. In addition, the majority of UNIX tools expects
    ASCII files and can't read 16-bit words as characters without
    major modifications. For these reasons, UCS-2 is not a suitable
    external encoding of Unicode in filenames, text files,
    environment variables, etc.

    The UTF-8 encoding defined in ISO 10646-1:2000 Annex D
    and also described in RFC 2279 as well as section 3.8
    of the Unicode 3.0 standard does not have these problems.
    It is clearly the way to go for using Unicode under Unix-style
    operating systems.>>

    The copy of forementioned Annex D can be found on Markus site:
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/ISO-10646-UTF-8.html.
    Encoding and decoding functions implemented here are
    based on the descriptions of algorithms found in the Annex D.

    Testing: The page http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
    has many pointers to variety of test data. One of them
    is a UTF-8 sampler from Kermit pages of Columbia University
    http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/utf8.html, where the
    phrase "I can eat glass and it doesn't hurt me." is
    produced in dozens of world languages.

        A table of the three fetch functions for cases k = 1, 2, 4,
        where k is a number of octets to fetch.
        Each function reads k octets and attempts to convert
        them to a single character if possible, otherwise
        it computes an integer represented by those characters.
        Case 3 is just a dummy placeholder.

        Data used by both 'encode and 'decode functions.
        Every non-zero element here has this property
        that its index within the block is equal to a total
        count of its consecutive most-significant 1-bits.
        The counter signals to the decoder a number of octets
        to use when decoding a character.

        Convert 'ansi string to a string

        This is an auxiliary function, just for testing.

        Note that when a UTF-encoded string is already
        available this function is no longer needed because
        such a string can be converted to a UCS-k string
        by simply invoking
            decode k utf-8-string .

        The condition is: k >= k-minimum. Hence
        any Latin-1 encoded string can be decoded to UCS-1,
        UCS-2 or UCS-4. Similarly, any Latin-2 encoded
        string can be decoded either to UCS-2 or UCS-4
        but not to UCS-1.
