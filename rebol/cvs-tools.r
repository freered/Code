comment {
This script includes versions of these functions for both R2 and R3. The R2
versions require either 2.7.7+ or many functions from R2/Forward. The R3
functions work with any version since the PARSE revamp.

The behavior of the functions is very similar to that of the mezzanines of
recent releases of REBOL, with similar treatment of function options and
error handling, and demonstrates some more modern REBOL techniques. It may be
useful to compare the R2 and R3 versions of the functions, to see how the
changes between the two platforms affects how you would optimize code. The
LOAD-CSV functions both take into account the limitations of their respective
PARSE dialects when it comes to handling string and binary code, and PARSE
control flow behavior.

The standards implemented here are http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180 for CSV
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 for date formatting, falling back to
Excel compatibility where the standards are ambiguous or underspecified, such
as for handling of malformed data. All standard platform newlines are handled
even if they are all used in the same file; the complexity of doing this is
why the newline delimiter is not an option at this time. Binary CSV works.
Passing a block of sources to LOAD-CSV loads them all into the same output
block, in the order specified.

There was no point in indluding a SAVE-CSV since it's pretty much a one-liner.
Just use WRITE/lines MAP-EACH x data [TO-CSV :x].

Warning: LOAD-CSV reads the entire source data into memory before parsing it.
You can use LOAD-CSV/part and then LOAD-CSV/into to do the parsing in parts.
An incremental reader is possible, but might be better done as a csv:// scheme.
