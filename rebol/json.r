    Title: "JSON to Rebol converter"
    Author: ["Romano Paolo Tenca" "Gregg Irwin" "Douglas Crockford"]
    Date: 5-Sep-2013
    Version: 0.0.9
    History: [
        0.0.1 13-Nov-2003 "First release" Romano
        0.0.2 26-Jan-2005 {
            Fixed array parsing
            Fixed empty string parsing
            Added comment parsing
            Added REBOL-to-JSON conversion
            Added option to output hash! instead of object! values (to test)
        } Gregg
        0.0.3 27-Jan-2005 {
            Aligned code with Romano's latest changes.
        } Gregg
        0.0.4 31-May-2005 {
            Added unicode decoding. (I think they were Romano's funcs I added)
        } Gregg
        0.0.5 14-Apr-2008 {
            Added "/" to the escaped char list (found by Will Arp).
        } Gregg
        0.0.6 20-Apr-2008 {
        	Cleanup and adjustment for changes in the spec. I've left the 
			comment support in place for now, though Doug Crockford says 
			there are no comments in JSON.

			Checked against the test suite from JSON.org. Test #18 should 
			fail, but doesn't. It's a depth limit not enforced here.
        }
        0.0.7 21-Apr-2008 {
        	Doug Crockford is confident that comments will not be re-added
        	to the JSON spec, so all comment support has been removed.
        	The comment rules also handled whitespace, so there have been a
        	number of rule changes due to that.
        } Gregg
        0.0.8 1-Feb-2010 {
            Fixed naive escaping.
        } Gregg
        0.0.9 5-Sep-2013 {
            Changed property-list and array-list rules to use ANY instead of
            recursion, to handle larger datasets without hitting PARSE limits.
        } Gregg
    ]
    Purpose: "Convert a JSON string to Rebol data, and vice versa."
    Notes: {
        From Romano:
        
        - Parse rules can be more robust if loops are used instead of
          recursion I used recursion to remain near the bnf grammar

        - Todo: better error handling

        - Because json has relaxed limits about property names
          in the rebol object can appear words that load cannot understand
          for example:
                ;json
                {"/word": 3}
            become
                ;rebol
                make object! [
                    /word: 3
                ]
            can be a problem if you do:

                load mold json-to-rebol str

            (Gregg added option to convert to objects or hashes as a test)
