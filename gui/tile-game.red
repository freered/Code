	Title: 		"Tile game"
	Purpose:	{An implementation in Red of the 4x4 sliding tile puzzle} 
	Author:		"Rudolf W. MEIJER (meijeru)"
	File:		%tile-game.red
	Needs:		'View
	Usage:		{
				 Click on any tile that is adjacent to the empty space
				 and it will shift to that space.
				 Try to obtain a given configuration, e.g. 1 to 15 in order.
				}
	Note:		{
				 See also http://www.tilepuzzles.com.
				 Original R2 code (with helpful comments) found in 
				 http://re-bol.com/rebol.html#section-6.3
				 (thanks Nick Antonaccio!).
				 This minimal version starts in the ordered configuration,
				 so preferably have someone else "mess it up" for you first.
				 A version which allows to randomize the order of the tiles
				 is in the making.
