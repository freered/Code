	Title:   "math-lab.red"
	Author:  "Gregg Irwin"
	File: 	 %math-lab.red
	Needs:	 'View
	Purpose: {
		Experiment, to see what an interactive "Lab" tool might look 
		like, for general language functions. i.e., take the idea of
		font-lab, effect-lab, gradient-lab, etc., and apply it to
		functions to aid in language discovery and learning.
		
		It can serve a few purposes:
		- Show users what functions are available in a given "category"
		- Show them live results
		- Pre-fill values of different types, to show what the funcs
		  support
		- Interactive testing of values, to probe/confirm errors
		- Explore possible new functionality. e.g. pair! * percent!
		
		TBD: Combo boxes on args can provide pre-selected values
		TBD: Click to get detailed help on a function or category
		     (e.g. math precedence note for all math ops)
		TBD: User entry field where they can enter their own combination
			 of ops and see a result. We could even show progressive
			 evaluation, maybe requiring parens.
		TBD: Sliders could be attached to arg fields, in some cases.

	;	script, where you never see the generated code, it may not matter, but
	;	sometimes you may start out with a dynamic plan, and later decide that
