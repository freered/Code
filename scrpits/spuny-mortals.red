    by-default all any-word! values (spoons included) are bounded to a so-called global context (system/words),
    but no value is associated with any of them, that's why our "universal" spoon is unsetted.

    we've rebinded every spoon to it's own context,
    hence there's still no spoon in global context!

    and now we've associated our `string!` value w/ spoon entry in global context
}

meditate on shelf-with-spoons   ; seems legit! however ...

append shelf-with-spoons [comma spoon]
comment {
    let's pile up our spoons together, 
    separating "global" spoon from "local" once with a comma
}

meditate on shelf-with-spoons   ; wake up neo

; now, let us make our spoon to be just a "spoon"

    however, last entry changed too!
    how can we avoid that?
